<blockquote>
<p>By the late <span class="sc">John H. DeWitt</span>, distinguished
jurist and historian, who was President of the
Tennessee Historical Society and Judge of the
Court of Civil Appeals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of the Hermitage, Andrew and Rachel
Jackson, their domestic life, their relations with their
friends and her kin, is of charming interest. Mrs.
Mary French Caldwell has recorded in this booklet
much of this history that has not hitherto been published.
She has made patient research into old records
and other documents, bringing to light Jackson&rsquo;s transactions
in certain lands, his acquisitions of home sites,
and building and rebuilding of homes. She has restated
who were his immediate kin by affinity and his closest
local friends. She has revived the color and atmosphere
of life at the Hermitage in the years when its master
was its beloved and dominating personality in the flesh.</p>
<p>The Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association has done a fine
service in publishing this manuscript for the benefit of
all lovers of this history. It should be eagerly obtained
and carefully studied by tourists as well as by all other
Americans. They will profit by it in culture and in
patriotism.</p>

volume. <i>Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage</i> is neither new
nor original, but it has had common usage for such
a long period of years that it seems by far the most
natural title for any work dealing with that historic
old mansion which offered a haven of peace and contentment
to &ldquo;Old Hickory,&rdquo; during both the storms
and the calms of his eventful career. In every respect
it is Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage. Its fertile fields
sustained him, its trees sheltered him, and the friendly
walls of the dwellings which he placed in the midst of
its broad acres were not only his refuge in times of dissatisfaction
with the outside world, but they formed the
castle to which he welcomed his friends. It mattered
little that the first Hermitage was an humble abode of
logs. He was its master, and his guest, whether he
happened to be the polished and elegant Aaron Burr or
some uncouth backwoodsman, was given a royal welcome.</p>
<p>The mistress of the Hermitage&mdash;Rachel, the beloved
and adored&mdash;was the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the whole establishment.
She was, to Andrew Jackson, the center of
the universe&mdash;the one fixed thing around which all of
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
the affairs of his life revolved. Her happiness was his
greatest concern and, in building a home, her comfort
and pleasure were his first consideration. She was not
the kind of a woman, however, to accept such adoration
without repaying it in thought and in deed. She was
an excellent housekeeper, a gracious hostess, and an
efficient manager of the whole plantation. Like many
women of the South, she was often left for months at
a time in charge of the entire estate, for travel was
difficult and tedious, and men who participated in public
affairs were forced to endure long absences from home.
During the early years of their marriage General Jackson,
either as an attorney or as judge, traveled hundreds
and hundreds of miles over wilderness trails. His
mercantile business, as well as his legal and political
activities, took him frequently to Philadelphia, Natchez,
or other distant points. Later, the Creek campaigns
and activities leading up to the Battle of New Orleans
kept him away from the Hermitage for months at a
time. After the victory in 1815 Mrs. Jackson accompanied
him on trips to Washington, to Florida, New
Orleans, and other places where his fame drew great
crowds around them. There never was a time, however,
when fame had any attraction for Rachel. All that
she asked was that the lord and master of the Hermitage
be freed to return to their peaceful fireside.</p>
<p>Of General Jackson&rsquo;s devotion to his wife there are
hundreds of evidences. From the time he killed Charles
Dickinson in the duel provoked by a rash reference to
the unfortunate circumstances of their marriage, until
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
his dying day, he was known for his almost fanatical
devotion to her, and his desire to punish anyone who
might cast a slur upon her fair name. Only Rachel&rsquo;s
suffering after Dickinson&rsquo;s death and her gentle restraint
kept his fiery temper under control.</p>
<p>The Hermitage stands upon the spot which Rachel
Jackson selected. The walls of its central portion
sheltered her, and to-day they house many objects made
sacred by her touch. In the long years which intervened
between her death and that of her distinguished
husband, her memory was kept green by his devotion.
The young lovers who, during his last years, laughed
and danced through the pleasant rooms and hallways
of the old mansion and wandered in the moonlight to
the magnolia-shaded tomb in the garden caught something
of his immortal love story.</p>
<p>Both he and Rachel loved young people. They had
no children, but in 1809 they adopted a baby&mdash;a nephew
of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s&mdash;and down through the years the
Hermitage was enlivened by the happy laughter of children
and of young people: sons and daughters of
neighbors, of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s kin, and of the General&rsquo;s
friends and associates. There have been many brides
and many happy wedding parties at the old mansion,
and the General himself was not averse to lending a
helping hand in cases where Dan Cupid did not make
progress rapidly enough to suit him.</p>
<p>Nothing reveals the gentle, human side of Andrew
Jackson more completely than a study of the contacts
made through various avenues of his home life. Nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
can anything else as thoroughly prove his wisdom and
good common sense. He had the greatest deference for
women and a great tenderness for children. He was a
compassionate master of slaves, a great lover of horses
and fine cattle, and an excellent farmer. He was a
shrewd trader and a meticulous observer of his own
debts to others&mdash;and theirs to him. His only bad business
deals, and they were not many, were those where
his affection for a kinsman or a friend got the better
of his cold reasoning power.</p>
<p>The picture which it is hoped that this little volume
will create in the minds of the readers is that of Andrew
Jackson, the husband and father, the host to friends
and neighbors, and to such of the nation&rsquo;s great as came
to his doors; the farmer who delighted in the productivity
of his broad acres; the merchant who rode each
day to his store at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill or Clover Bottom; the
warrior who returned with the laurels of New Orleans
to a log house; the statesman, weary with fame and
the long, lonely years, who came back to his Hermitage
to sit out the remainder of his days near the tomb of
his beloved Rachel.</p>
<p>It is this conception of Jackson that the Hermitage
perpetuates. The little museum which was once the
nursery of his grandchildren houses relics of his military
career and a rare collection of his state papers.
Of this side of his life the nation is already well informed.
The house itself speaks eloquently of the life
which once vibrated its now quiet rooms. His office is
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
filled with books which knew the frequent touch of his
hands; his dressing gown lies across a chair in his bedchamber,
and the miniature of Rachel is in its accustomed
place on the table at his bedside. In the parlors
the portraits of his &ldquo;military family&rdquo; look down upon
silent rooms which, when they knew them, were full
of music and laughter. The dining room, once the
center of a lavish hospitality, is quiet, and the kitchen
is no longer filled with negroes, bustling about and
singing before a great open fire. It requires no great
powers of imagination to people these rooms again.
The inanimate objects are there. They have been carefully
preserved by a patriotic group of women who realized
their value in time to keep them in their original
setting. Down through the years they will be guarded
jealously by women who follow in the footsteps of the
founders of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association, and so
will be preserved the home of one of the greatest of all
Americans and the setting of one of the most beautiful
love stories of all times.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">ANDREW JACKSON&rsquo;S HERMITAGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning at a Hickory tree....&rdquo; There is something
prophetic in the description of the tract of land
which Andrew Jackson bought from Nathaniel Hays
on August 23, 1804. Nothing had yet happened in
the career of General Jackson which even hinted that
his wiry strength of body and of will would some day
win for him the enduring title, &ldquo;Old Hickory.&rdquo; The
long, weary, homeward march from Natchez with his
loyal Tennesseans was a decade ahead of him. The
battles of the Horseshoe and New Orleans and the fame
which followed them were undreamed-of events of a
shadowy, uncertain future. No one foretold that the
hickory tree would become symbolic of the man, nor
that the tract of land he was buying would some day
be one of the nation&rsquo;s most important shrines. Certainly
no one saw in the purchaser the future idol of
the nation and the ruler of its destinies during a period
which called not only for superior statesmanship, but
for unconquerable will and determination.</p>
<p>It is even more interesting to trace the history of the
Hermitage tract back to the original grant made by the
State of North Carolina to Nathaniel Hays, on April
17, 1786, and to see that the hickory tree still holds the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
initial place in defining the boundary line. This old
grant reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;State of North Carolina. Know ye that we have
granted unto Nathaniel Hays six hundred and forty
acres of land in Davidson county including a spring
which lies in the entrance into Jones&rsquo; bent on the South

a hackberry in Colo John Donelson&rsquo;s line thirty-one

along Samuel Hays line, East four hundred and eight

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>When this tract was finally deeded to the State of
Tennessee in 1856, the description of boundaries had
become more technical. The surveyor began his measurements
at a stake in Kerr&rsquo;s line, and there is little in
his description to remind the reader of the original
boundary lines. The deed held by the State of Tennessee
contains, however, a reference to the spring and
the spring branch, but instead of being measured, in the
picturesque fashion of the old-timers, from tree to tree,
the distances are reckoned from stake to stake, and the
symbolic hickory tree is dropped from the legal record
of the boundaries.</p>
<p>This last recorded deed of the property, which appears
on Page 149, Book 24, at the Davidson County
Court House, reads in part: &ldquo;... the following parcel
of land situate in said county and State and being part
of the late residence of Andrew Jackson deceased, containing
by survey of Jesse B. Clements, Esquire, five
hundred acres of land counted as follows, viz., Beginning

formerly Col. William Ward&rsquo;s land running thence
East with his North boundary line, crossing the Lebanon
Turnpike Road at one hundred and twenty-nine

poles to the beginning corner and including the late
mansion, Tomb, Spring and Spring House, Barn and
Stables of Genl. Andrew Jackson, deceased, as will more
fully appear by reference to the plat at the head of this
deed which is made part thereof....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Andrew Jackson moved to the Hermitage, he
lived on a near-by estate known as &ldquo;Hunter&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;
It is well, however, before going into the history of his
home on this property, to trace briefly his residences
from the time of his arrival in Davidson County in the
fall of 1788.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>We are legally informed of his presence and the beginning
of his professional duties by the statement in
Minute Book A, Davidson County Court, under the date
of January 5, 1789, to the effect that &ldquo;Andrew Jackson
Esquire produced a licence to practice as an attorney at
law in the Severall County courts in this State: and
now in this court has taken the Oath of an Attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Attorney Jackson, then in his twenty-first
year, had come West to make his fortune. With him
was John McNairy, who had but recently been appointed
judge of the Superior Court of North Carolina&rsquo;s
western district. John Overton, another young lawyer,
had come West from Virginia by way of Kentucky, and
it soon happened that he and young Jackson found
common quarters at the home of the Widow Donelson.
The young men were fortunate, for fare in such a home
as Mrs. Donelson&rsquo;s was far better than that in the few
stations or military posts which offered the only other
shelter for young unattached men. Many of the families
still lived in the stations and, in the most severe
periods of Indian hostilities, every home which was not
a well-manned fortress was abandoned. Mrs. Donelson
had come to the Cumberland settlement in 1780 with
her husband, Col. John Donelson, commander of the
pioneer flotilla which brought the families of the first
settlers to the site of Nashville. They arrived April
24, 1780, with their large family and slaves, and settled
on the now famous &ldquo;Clover Bottom&rdquo; tract on Stone&rsquo;s
River. Summer and autumn of that year, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
brought serious difficulties. Indians had attacked the
settlement, food was scarce, crops had been lost in an
overflow, and Col. Donelson was faced with the necessity
of returning to the east on business for himself and
other settlers. His large family was a serious responsibility
and, rather than leave them without his protection
he took them, in the fall of 1780, to the Kentucky
settlement, where food was more plentiful, and where
they would not be such a burden to the other settlers.
The residence of the Donelson family until 1785 was
in the neighborhood of Harrodsburg, but Col. Donelson,
his older sons, and his sons-in-law, were engaged in
various activities which kept them in motion up and
down the western frontier from Natchez to the Cumberland
and Harrodsburg. They were preparing, however,
to take up a permanent residence in the Cumberland in
1785 when Col. Donelson, on his way from Kentucky
to the Cumberland settlement, met a mysterious death,
either at the hands of the Indians or two young white
men who were, for a part of his journey, his companions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Donelson and her sons, however, had established
themselves on lands in the Cumberland settlement. The
home of Mrs. Donelson was on the opposite side of the
river from Jones&rsquo; Bend, in which Jackson was later to
own lands and at the entrance of which his Hermitage
was to be located. About the time of Jackson&rsquo;s arrival
on the Cumberland, Mrs. Donelson was forced to send
to Kentucky to bring her daughter, Rachel, who, in
1785, had been married to Lewis Robards, of Mercer
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
County, to the protection of the parental roof. Young
Mrs. Robards had been made desperately unhappy by
the ill nature and unjust suspicions of her husband and
he, in a fit of temper, ordered her to leave his home.
No sooner had she been carried to Tennessee by her
brother than the husband became repentant and John
Overton, who had boarded at the Robards&rsquo; home in
Kentucky and was familiar with both families, assumed
the r&ocirc;le of peacemaker. Consequently a reconciliation
was brought about and Robards came to live at Mrs.
Donelson&rsquo;s, with the avowed intention of not repeating
his unfair treatment of his young wife and the apparent
determination to make his home in the Cumberland. At
any rate, in July, 1788, he acquired two important tracts
of land in the neighborhood. The first was a tract of
something over a thousand acres, purchased from William
Mabane. It was, according to the deed, &ldquo;A certain
tract or parcel of land situate lying and being in Green
County and State aforesaid on the West fork of Big
Harpeth River....&rdquo; The consideration was &ldquo;the sum
of two hundred pounds current money.&rdquo; (Davidson
County was taken off of a portion of Greene County.)</p>
<p>The other tract, which by a peculiar turn of fate
was to become the property of Andrew Jackson, was
later known as &ldquo;Hunter&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; This tract was
granted to Lewis Robards by the State of North Carolina
on the tenth day of July, 1788. It was sold by
him for two hundred pounds to John Shannon on March
19, 1794&mdash;a significant fact, for on January 17, 1794,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s second marriage to Rachel, Robards&rsquo;
divorced wife, took place. It is evident that Lewis
Robards had no further interest in lands in Tennessee.</p>
<p>In the time which intervened between Robards&rsquo; arrival
at Mrs. Donelson&rsquo;s in 1788 and his final departure
for Kentucky in May or June, 1790, the old story of
the jealous husband was repeated. This time Andrew
Jackson was the target of his anger and unjust suspicions,
just as another young man&mdash;one Peyton Short&mdash;had
been back in Kentucky. The incidents of this
period are well known. As the breach between Robards
and his wife widened, Jackson and Overton removed
to Mansker&rsquo;s Station and, finally, Robards set out for
Kentucky alone, threatening, however, to return and to
force Rachel to go back to Kentucky with him. To
escape him she fled to friends in Natchez either late in
the year of 1790 or early in 1791, and Andrew Jackson
went along to help protect the party against the Indians.
Later news came to the Cumberland that a
divorce had been granted Robards by the Virginia
legislature in an act passed December 20, 1790, and
Jackson hastened to Natchez to woo the unhappy
Rachel. They were married in Natchez in August,
1791, and returned to Nashville in September. It was
not until December, 1793, that Robards revealed the
fact that the Virginia legislature had granted him only
the right to sue for divorce in the courts of Kentucky.
He exercised that right in the Mercer County court,
term of September, 1793, and in the following December
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
John Overton brought to the astounded Jackson the
news that the Natchez marriage had not been legal.
The second marriage took place openly, and though the
circumstances which necessitated it were deplored by
friends of the Jacksons, the situation was fully understood
and no blame was attached to either of them.</p>
<p>About the time of the second marriage the Jacksons
were probably living on a tract of land in &ldquo;Jones&rsquo; Bent&rdquo;
known as Poplar Grove. There is little known of this
period, but a letter of Jackson&rsquo;s, dated May 16, 1794,
is headed &ldquo;Poplar Grove, Tenn.&rdquo; This tract, bought
from John Donelson for the sum of one hundred pounds,
April 30, 1793, was, according to the deed recorded
at the Davidson County Court House, located on &ldquo;the
lower end of a survey of 630 acres granted the said
John Donelson by patent.&rdquo; It is described as being
&ldquo;on the south side of Cumberland River in Jones Bent
and bounded as follows&mdash;Beginning at sugar tree red
oak and elm on the bank of the river, the lower end of
the tract running thence north sixty degrees....&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The next important purchase from the standpoint of
Jackson&rsquo;s homestead was that of the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill tract
from John Shannon on March 7, 1796, &ldquo;for and in
consideration of the sum of seven hundred dollars to
him in hand paid by the said Andrew Jackson.&rdquo; It is
impossible to trace definitely the residence of Rachel
and Andrew during the years intervening between their
marriage in the late summer of 1791 and the acquisition
of the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill tract in 1796. They must,
for a period at least, have lived with Mrs. Donelson, or
in the household of some member of the family. Rachel
had frequently lived at the home of her sister Jane,
Mrs. Robert Hays, of Haysborough&mdash;once the rival of
Nashville. A study of Indian hostilities of the period
indicates that permanent residence outside the strongholds
of the community was not practical. In 1792
Buchanan&rsquo;s station was attacked by a party of several
hundred Indians, and as late as September, 1794, five
men were fired upon by the Indians &ldquo;near Mr. Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s, on the south side of Cumberland River.&rdquo;
One was killed and two wounded.</p>
<p>Several things happened in 1794 which indicate that
the Jacksons were established in a home of their own&mdash;the
reference in a communication to the War Department
to the Indian depredations &ldquo;near Mr. Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s&rdquo;; the previously mentioned letter, which
Jackson himself headed &ldquo;Poplar Grove, Tenn. May 16,
1794;&rdquo; and freedom from Indian attacks on outlying
settlements. The important Nickajack expedition,
which brought an end to all organized Indian hostilities
in the section, took place in that year.</p>
<p>The death of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s mother, Rachel Stockley
Donelson, which, according to a marker erected a few
years ago by members of the Donelson family, occurred
in 1794, was offered in the first edition of the present
work as another reason that Andrew and Rachel Jackson
had gone into a home of their own. This seems to
be in error. As far as the writer knows at present, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
date of her death has not been established. However,
it was after October 2, 1800. (See pp. 491-92, <i>General
Jackson&rsquo;s Lady</i>, by Mary French Caldwell.)</p>
<p>The Nickajack expedition was noteworthy, not only
for the success of its immediate objects, but also for its
effectiveness in bringing a lasting peace to the frontiers,
and for the fact that it was conducted in defiance of the
Federal government. The territorial governor, William
Blount, in a letter to General Knox, Secretary of
War, written in Knoxville, October 2, 1794, recites the
sufferings of the inhabitants in the &ldquo;district of Mero&rdquo;
and tells of depredations which took place while the
frontiersmen were on their way to the Cherokee Lower
Towns&mdash;Nickajack, Running Water, and others of
lesser importance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While Major Ore was out against the Lower Town,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;the Indians continued their depredations
against the district of Mero. On the night of the fourteenth
September, the Indians pulled up a part of the
stockading of Morgan&rsquo;s station, and took out a valuable
gelding tied to his dwelling house. The sixteenth
of the same month, a woman on Red river near Major
Sharp&rsquo;s was killed by the Indians. The same day a
party of Indians fired upon five men near Mr. Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s, on the south side of Cumberland river, killed
one man, and wounded two; among the latter is Mr.
John Bosley. The same party burned the houses of
John Donnelson and the widow Hayes. From the nearness
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of the time, and the distance of the situation,
within which the above injuries were committed, there
must have been three parties of Indians.&rdquo; (<i>Indian
Affairs</i>, Vol. I, page 663.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nickajack expedition began on September 8,
1794, so at the time that these depredations took place
the settlement was in an unprotected condition. Since
before the Civil War Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s participation
in this campaign has been a matter of dispute. The
historian Ramsey, in his <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>, said that
he served as a private; but Putnam, in his work on
Middle Tennessee, basing his statement on the word of
men who participated in the expedition, declares that
he did not go. Putnam is followed by Parton and,
since both of them have so vehemently denied that he
had a part in it, this position has been almost generally
accepted.</p>
<p>Ramsey based his statement on papers of Willie
Blount, half brother of the territorial governor, who, at
the time was secretary of the territory, and was later
himself governor of Tennessee. Both Putnam and
Parton have failed to take into consideration the importance
of Blount&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;or, perhaps, did not
have access to his papers. A letter which should settle
the controversy permanently has been recently acquired
by the state historian and librarian, Mrs. John Trotwood
Moore. This letter, written to General Jackson
on January 4, 1830, by Willie Blount, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have by me the rough draft of sundry letters,
from me to you, none of which have yet been either
copied or mailed: they relate to things gone bye, &amp; so,
no matter whether they are ever sent or not: they speak
only of the pleasurable feelings I experience in the
knowledge I possess of the motives and conduct in the
various promotions of my friend yourself and the result
of your efforts since the battle of Nickajack, commanded
by Orr: where, as Sampson Williams says, our
friend, the Mountain Leader, the friend of man, was
at that never to be forgotten good days work, in which
you lent an active useful hand, that gave peace to our
frontier, never to be forgotten by me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is fitting that this letter should be published for
the first time in a volume on the Hermitage, for it is
an interesting contribution to the incomplete records of
Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s early career in Tennessee. It is not
strange, of course, that these records should be scant.
Jackson was too young, too busy, and too completely
unaware of the greatness which awaited him to have an
interest in preserving personal records of this early
period. Certainly his acquaintances could not have seen
in the tall, slender, red-haired young attorney a future
president and a great general.</p>
<p>Many disconnected court records may be found. A
few of his account books survive and some of his letters
have escaped oblivion; but, for the most part, the records
of his early military activities, his mercantile business,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
and his land deals are incomplete. It is impossible to
quote in detail from the court records of his land deals&mdash;that
would require a separate volume. It is possible
to show from them, however, that when he owned both
the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill and Hermitage tracts, his holdings
in the Hermitage neighborhood totaled something like
1,200 acres. The extent of his land fluctuated from
time to time with his changing fortunes. For instance
he sold the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill tract in 1804, bought it back
at a later period of prosperity, and sold it again under
financial pressure. At his death he held a plantation
in Mississippi, as well as his Hermitage estate and adjoining
lands bought from the heirs of Savern Donelson.</p>
<p>The Hermitage estate, as described by Andrew Jackson
himself on September 30, 1841 (Bassett, Correspondence
of Andrew Jackson, Vol. VI, p. 125) was as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is the boundery of my Hermitage
track and its appendages, viz, Beginning at a stake,
Andrew Jacksons South East corner, on Major A. J.
Donelsons west boundery line and Mrs. Wards North
East corner, running line thence North Eight east with
A. J. Donelson to a post oak near A. J. Donelsons gate,
then West to the turn pike road, then with the turn pike
road to the old road leading to James Saunders ferry,
thence North with A. J. Donelsons line to an ash and
Locust, then East with his line to a black oak, thence
North with his line to the North boundery line of Hugh
Hays premption, thence West with the old preemption
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
line to a stone, the North West corner of Hugh Hays
preemption thence south with this preemption line,
passing a walnutt corner, (the South West and North
West corner of said Hugh Hays, and Nathaniel Hays
preemption) continued South with said N. Hays line
to the mouth of the lane leading to Wm. Donelsons to
a cedar stake, the North east corner of Savern Donelsons
640 acres that <i>he died</i> seized of and the South east
corner of William Donelsons land, thence West along
the old line to a cedar stake, corner to A. Jackson and
William Donelson, thence down the meanders of a
branch to a stone corner, thence south with Wm. Donelsons
line, passing his corner, and with T. Dodsons line
to a white ash at Dodsons fence, then East with Dodsons
line, and Mrs. Wards line to an Elm, then North with
Mrs. Wards line to a dogwood, Andrew Jacksons corner,
thence East to the beginning, containing in all nine
hundred and sixty acres. I send you the exterior
boundery of my whole tract....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His holdings in other parts of the territory which is
now Tennessee were almost as limitless as the wilderness
itself. Like the other leaders of the period&mdash;although
on a somewhat smaller scale than his brother-in-law,
Stockley Donelson, William Blount, and John
Sevier&mdash;he dealt in great bodies of wild lands. One
interesting thing that Jackson&rsquo;s records show is that he
was remarkably successful in many of his deals, particularly
in the smaller ones which had to do with the
exchange of lands in the neighborhood of Nashville.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
It is extremely interesting to observe that on March
19, 1794, Lewis Robards sold the future Hunter&rsquo;s Hill
tract to John Shannon for the sum of two hundred
pounds; that on March 7, 1796, Andrew Jackson bought
it of Shannon for seven hundred dollars; and that on
July 6, 1804, Jackson sold it to Edward Ward for
$10,000. A rough estimate of sixteen land deals recorded
in Davidson County in Books C and D shows
that between May 3, 1793, and February 18, 1797, he
had bought something like twenty-seven thousand acres
of land at an expenditure of about $20,000. These
records show his major transactions of this period for
two very obvious reasons&mdash;the land to the east was already
largely taken up and the land in the major portion
of what is now Middle Tennessee, as well as that in the
future West Tennessee, was recorded in Davidson
County. These deals are catalogued briefly as follows:</p>

<p class="tb">Book E records the purchase of 1,000 acres for $500,
and this with the deals mentioned in Book F adds
11,425 acres to the total of 27,825 acres mentioned in
deeds between 1793 and 1797, making a grand total
of 39,250 acres. These eighteen transactions show that
for most of the land Jackson paid a reasonably good
price for the period, and that sometimes he made a
fabulous profit. This study by no means gives a complete
picture of his land deals, but it gives an idea
of his major deals at the period of his greatest activity
in this field. There never was a time in his life when
records of his personal business would not show some
activity in the purchase or sale of land.</p>
<p>His mercantile business, which is quite as interesting,
was confined to the earlier period of his life in
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Tennessee. It began about 1795 and ended, tradition
says, in 1809, when as a wedding gift to General John
Coffee, his former partner, he tore up the notes which
he held on the Clover Bottom store.</p>
<p>As early as 1795 we find Andrew Jackson in partnership
with David Allison in a shipment of goods from
Philadelphia to Nashville. Five years earlier Allison,
Jackson, Overton, and others were licensed to practice
law in the new territory by Governor William Blount,
and various records show Allison&rsquo;s activities in Davidson
County, as well as in Philadelphia, where he was a
well-known merchant. From this connection and subsequent
associations in both land and mercantile deals
developed a relationship which was finally to force
Jackson to sell his handsome Hunter&rsquo;s Hill tract in
order to meet his obligations. It is a long and complicated
story, and its chief importance in the present
connection is that responsibility for Jackson&rsquo;s loss of
Hunter&rsquo;s Hill and his removal to more humble quarters
on the Hermitage estate is usually attributed to the Allison
deal. It is a significant fact, however, that Allison&rsquo;s
failure, which occurred about 1795, did not result
in the sale of Hunter&rsquo;s Hill until July 6, 1804. It is
reasonable, then, to suppose that it by no means crippled
Jackson, as most writers contend; although it undoubtedly
marked the beginning of a long struggle through a
period of financial unrest and depression which resulted
finally in a plan of retrenchment and reorganization.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>On the twenty-third of August, 1804, Jackson paid
Nathaniel Hays $3,400 for the 425-acre tract, &ldquo;with
its appurtenances,&rdquo; which was to be known later as the
Hermitage.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> This reference to appurtenances would
indicate that some kind of a building or &ldquo;improvements&rdquo;
stood on the property when Jackson bought it. This
theory is strengthened by the fact that the present study
has revealed no records which prove definitely that
Andrew Jackson erected a log building at the Hermitage
in 1804 or 1805, and by the tradition in the Hays
family that one of its members built the Hermitage.
Another point which strengthens it is that both of the
log houses now standing on the Hermitage estate have
in their walls the customary holes for rifles which were
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
made in the days of Indian fighting. This was not
necessary at the time Jackson bought the Hermitage,
for Indian hostilities were ended by 1795.</p>
<p>There must have been, however, considerable remodeling
of the buildings, even though no new house
was erected. Account books of the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill store,
which form a valuable part of the collection of historic
documents at the Hermitage, show that in November,
1804, &ldquo;17 window lights&rdquo; are charged to Jackson&rsquo;s
personal account. It is possible that as time goes by a
letter or other record may come to light which will tell
something more definite on the building or remodeling
of the log Hermitage. These account books are especially
important in placing the removal from Hunter&rsquo;s
Hill to the Hermitage. The last entry at the Hunter&rsquo;s
Hill store was made on April 5, 1805, and the first at
the Clover Bottom store on April 9. It is interesting to
observe in this connection that the first letter in Bassett&rsquo;s
<i>Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</i>, headed at the
Hermitage, was dated April 7, 1805. There is a lapse
of several months in the letters, however, since the last
one Bassett quotes from Hunter&rsquo;s Hill is dated August
25, 1804. It is probable, although not a definitely
established fact, that the removal of the store and residence
took place simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is known, of course, that Hunter&rsquo;s Hill was a
commodious, two-story frame building&mdash;a marked contrast
with the usual log houses of the period. In later
years it was burned, and there remains to-day on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
site of the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill residence nothing more than
a few scant traces of houses which may, or may not,
have been a part of the dwellings, slave quarters, store,
or other buildings used while the Jacksons lived there.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
The spring, of course, remains; the Cumberland flows
gently along its distant, tree-lined banks; and fertile
fields still yield up their annual tribute to careful husbandry.
But marks of Jackson&rsquo;s occupation of the land
are obliterated and, except as the story is pieced together
from bits of information gathered here and there, its
history is lost in obscurity.</p>
<p>More is known of the log Hermitage, although its
history is far from complete. Most of the letters of
people who were guests of the Jacksons during this
period are tantalizing for their lack of detail. The
best and more than likely the most authentic description
of the interior of the log Hermitage is that given
in Buell&rsquo;s <i>History of Andrew Jackson</i>. The author, in
a series of interviews with Mrs. James K. Polk, wife of
President Polk, has preserved much important material
relating to the Jackson household. In his preface to
Mrs. Polk&rsquo;s narrative he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the early seventies of the 19th Century the
author of this work visited Nashville more than once
in the capacity of a newspaper correspondent. On
those occasions he enjoyed the honor and pleasure of
calling upon Mrs. Sarah Childress Polk, widow of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
President. Mrs. Polk was in her seventy-first year
then. Her fund of historical and social reminiscences
was exhaustless, and the best efforts to reproduce in
print her faculty of relation would be feeble. Born in
1803, about twenty-eight or thirty miles from Nashville
and not over twenty miles from the Hermitage, she
had known the Jacksons from her earliest childhood.
When she grew up and married Mr. Polk, the intimacy
became still closer, and the relations between
General Jackson and her husband in public life on the
most important scale gave her recollections a quality
of historical value not equalled by those of any other
woman of her time....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Polk said that Mrs. Jackson&mdash;or &lsquo;Aunt&rsquo; Rachel&mdash;was
literally the childless mother of the whole neighborhood....
In their vicinage General and Mrs. Jackson
were, of course, by far the most important persons.
But no one would suspect it from observing the way
and manner of their intercourse with the neighbors. In
this respect the General was the most democratic of
men, while Mrs. Jackson was at once the soul of merry-making
and the embodiment of benevolence and charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their home manners, Mrs. Polk said, were the most
charming concert of simplicity with dignity. The General
always in their earlier life said &lsquo;Mrs. Jackson,&rsquo;
both in the second and third persons; though, when
their little adopted son began to talk, he got into the
habit of addressing her as &lsquo;mother.&rsquo; On her part, Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Jackson invariably spoke of and to him as &lsquo;Mr. Jackson,&rsquo;
until after the War of 1812, she yielded to the universal
fashion and began to call him &lsquo;General.&rsquo; But no one
ever heard either address the other by the first name or
by any term of endearment or familiarity whatever.
In fact, though more winning kindliness than that
which marked the manners of both could not be imagined,
there was yet an atmosphere of quiet self-respect
and calm dignity about them which gently,
though none the less imperatively, commanded scrupulous
courtesy in their presence....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hermitage of the period now under consideration,
Mrs. Polk said, was not the commodious country
house so familiar to devout Democrats in pilgrimages
of later years. It was a group of log houses in close
proximity to each other. The principal one had been
built for a block-house in the days of Indian alarms,
afterwards used as a store and, about 1804, converted
into a dwelling. It, like all block-houses, was two
stories high. Near it were three smaller log houses,
one story high with low attics. These were used as
lodgings for members of the family or guests. The
main building&mdash;the former block-house&mdash;had on the
first floor one very large room with a huge fireplace
capable of taking in a good-sized load of wood at a
time. A lean-to had been built on at the back containing
two rooms, one of which was used as the family sleeping
quarters, the other as a pantry&mdash;or &lsquo;buttery&rsquo; as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
phrase was then. But the great room, about twenty-four
feet by twenty-six, was at once kitchen, dining-room,
sitting-room and parlor, and the large table that
stood in the middle of it, capable of seating twelve to
fourteen people comfortably, was always &lsquo;set.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... General Jackson was a wonderful adept in
the art of anecdote, and particularly delighted in incidents
having a spice of wit or humor. Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
observations and experience were, of course, much more
limited, but she, too, was a fluent talker and always
entertaining.... She was an insatiable reader and
was always far better informed upon current topics
than the average woman of her time, even those who
had been well educated. She was also a prolific writer,
keeping up a close correspondence with her numerous
relatives and with the General whenever he was absent
from home. Her letters were simply her conversation
on paper, with no effort at eloquence. As for grammar
and orthography, Mrs. Polk said, neither in those days
was the exact science it has since become, and she declared
that while in the White House she had received
notes from &lsquo;leaders in society&rsquo; in Washington that
would not compare favorably with the most hurried or
careless of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Polk was excellently educated for her time. As
a very young girl she was sent to the Moravian Female
Academy at Salem, North Carolina, and later she was
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
placed in a girls&rsquo; school in Nashville. She came, of
course, a generation after Mrs. Jackson and enjoyed
privileges which were not known in frontier days.
Mrs. Polk&rsquo;s estimate of the Jacksons is especially important,
not only because she knew them intimately from
her childhood, but also because by training and long
contact with the nation&rsquo;s leaders and the great from
other parts of the world, she had a background which
qualified her for unbiased judgment.</p>
<p>Another child destined for future greatness visited
the Hermitage when the log buildings were the family
dwellings. He was Jefferson Davis, future president of
the Confederate States of America. What would &ldquo;Old
Hickory&rdquo; have said, when little &ldquo;Jeff&rdquo; Davis raced
ponies and played with Andrew Jackson, Jr., and other
little boys at the Hermitage, had he been able to foretell
the future of his small guest? Fortunately for the
children, no shadow crossed their pathway, and even
&ldquo;Old Hickory&rdquo; had not been forced to declare in
thunderous tones: &ldquo;Our Federal Union&mdash;it must be
preserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Let it always be remembered, however, that Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s passionate loyalty to the Union was based
upon an equally passionate devotion to the Rights of
the States. He said in a rough draft of his second
inaugural address, dated March 1, 1833 (Bassett, <i>Correspondence
of Andrew Jackson</i>, Vol. V, p. 26): &ldquo;In
proportion, therefore, as the general government encroaches
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
upon the rights of the states, in the same proportion
does it impair its own power and detract from
its ability to fulfil the purposes of its creation.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The story of Jefferson Davis&rsquo; journey from Mississippi
to the Hermitage is told briefly in his <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I was seven years old,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;I was
sent on horseback through what was then called &lsquo;The
Wilderness&rsquo;&mdash;by the country of the Choctaw and the
Chickasaw nations&mdash;to Kentucky, and placed in a
Catholic institution then known as St. Thomas, in
Washington County, near the town of Springfield. In
that day (1815) there were no steamboats, nor were
there stage-coaches traversing the country. The river
trade was conducted on flat and keel-boats. The last
named only could be taken up the river. Commerce
between the Western States and the Lower Mississippi
was confined to the water routes. The usual mode of
travel was on horseback or afoot. Many persons who
had gone down the river in flat-boats walked back
through the wilderness to Kentucky, Ohio, and elsewhere.
We passed many of these, daily, on the
road....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The party with which I was sent to Kentucky
consisted of Major Hinds (who had command of the
famous battalion of Mississippi dragoons at the battle
of New Orleans), his wife, his sister-in-law, a niece, a
maid-servant, and his son Howell, who was near my
own age, and, like myself, mounted on a pony. A servant
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
had a sumpter mule with some supplies, besides
bed and blankets for camping out. The journey to
Kentucky occupied several weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we reached Nashville we went to the Hermitage.
Major Hinds wished to visit his friend and companion-in-arms,
General Jackson. The whole party was
so kindly received that we remained several weeks.
During that period I had the opportunity a boy has to
observe a great man&mdash;a standpoint of no small advantage&mdash;and
I have always remembered with warm
affection the kind and tender wife who then presided
over his house....</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson&rsquo;s house at that time was a roomy
log-house. In front of it was a grove of fine forest
trees, and behind it were his cotton and grain fields.
I have never forgotten the unaffected and well-bred
courtesy which caused him to be remarked by court-trained
diplomats, when President of the United States,
by reason of his very impressive bearing and manner.
Notwithstanding the many reports that have been made
of his profanity, I remember that he always said grace
at his table and I never heard him utter an oath. In
the same connection, although he encouraged his
adopted son, A. Jackson, Jr., Howell Hinds, and myself
in all contests of activity, pony-riding included, he
would not allow us to wrestle; for, he said, to allow
hands to be put on one another might lead to a fight.
He was always very gentle and considerate.... Our
stay with General Jackson was enlivened by the visits
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
of his neighbors, and we left the Hermitage with great
regret and pursued our journey. In me he inspired
reverence and affection that has remained with me
through my whole life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These intimate glimpses of the Jackson household
during the period of residence in the log Hermitage
throw an interesting light upon the customs and surroundings
of the family at this time. These years&mdash;from
1805 to 1819&mdash;were tremendously important in
Jackson&rsquo;s career. They were not entirely happy years,
for they included such unfortunate events as the Dickinson
duel in 1806, the shooting affray with the Bentons
in 1814, the delightful, but misunderstood visits of
Aaron Burr, and the public expressions of disapproval
which these affairs produced. Through it all ran the
unhappy references to the Robards&rsquo; divorce and the unfortunate
circumstances attending the first marriage of
the Jacksons. It was a period of Herculean struggle
against material odds, as well as against public opinion,
but it was not without a brighter side in which gayety,
color, and genuine happiness stand out.</p>
<p>Relatives, neighbors and, often, distinguished guests
from a distance, composed a brilliant and congenial
company&mdash;in spite of the fact that their rank varied
from the simplest backwoodsman to a former vice
president of the United States, and their common background
was a log house in the far west. Most charming
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and gracious of all was Aaron Burr, but lately vice
president, who first visited the Hermitage May 29,
1805. He was received by the entire community in a
manner which befitted his importance and his high rank
in national affairs. Public dinners were given for him,
and he was received cordially by the leading citizens.
He returned to Nashville in August, 1805, and spent
a few days as a guest of General Jackson. Little is
known of the details of this visit, but from the Hermitage
at this time he wrote to his daughter, Theodosia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For a week I have been lounging at the house of
General Jackson, once a lawyer, after a judge, now a
planter; a man of intelligence, and one of those prompt,
frank, ardent souls whom I love to meet. The General
has no children, but two lovely nieces made a visit of
some days, contributed greatly to my amusement, and
have cured me of all the evils of my wilderness
jaunt....&rdquo; (Parton&rsquo;s <i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nieces were, of course, nieces of Mrs. Jackson&mdash;part
of that bevy of charming Donelson girls which
throughout the history of the Hermitage household lent
grace and gayety to its social affairs. Many of them
married young men who were closely associated with
the General in his military and political activities, and
in this way strengthened by ties of kinship the relationship
which common public interest had created.
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
General Jackson had no kin of his own in Tennessee,
but he took Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s family to his heart as if it
were his own.</p>
<p>Burr&rsquo;s final visit to Nashville in December, 1806,
was the one around which the storm of public disapproval
centered. His reception at this time was courteous,
but somewhat cool, for rumors of his proposed
invasion of the West had already begun to filter in.
The <i>Impartial Review and Cumberland Repository</i> of
December 20 carried the announcement that &ldquo;Colo. Burr
arrived on Wednesday last and intends proceeding to
Natchez in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His departure was recorded almost as briefly in the
same paper, issue of Saturday, December 27: &ldquo;Colo.
Burr embarked from this place for New Orleans on
Monday last, with two large flat boats, which did not
appear to be loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The papers of these and subsequent dates carried,
however, many communications which show the national
alarm at Burr&rsquo;s presence in the Western country and
indicate that while Nashville was slow to condemn him,
it was ready to rise to a man to march against him
should reports that he was planning an invasion of the
Western country prove true. For the most part, however,
he was given the benefit of the doubt, and while
he was in Nashville he was received as an interesting
and charming acquisition to its social circle.</p>
<p>There are many interesting stories of Burr&rsquo;s visits
to Nashville, of his elegant manners, his wit, and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
personal magnetism as well as his alleged duplicity.
Some of them were revived in the Jackson presidential
campaign of 1828 in an effort to prove that he and
Andrew Jackson were united in intrigue against the
United States. These arguments brought forth a letter
which was not only important in the campaign, but is
especially valuable at present, for its picture of Nashville
social life and the participation of the master and
mistress of the Hermitage in it. This letter, written
by T. G. Watkins, at Charlottesville, on May 14, 1828,
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the winter of 1806 or &rsquo;7, to the best of my recollection
as to time, I was a member of the dancing
assemblies for the season, in Nashville. On one of the
evenings preceding a stated meeting for the night, it
was communicated to the managers for the season, two
of whom I distinctly recollect were the present John
Overton, LLD, of Travellers&rsquo; Rest, near Nashville, and
the late Dr. Hansen Catlett, that Col. Burr was in town.
He was immediately ticketed, as Judge Overton informed
me, nem. con., I think, by the managers. Some
one, I do not now recollect who, objected to this act
of the managers. Judge Overton remarked that he had
concurred in the invitation from a conviction of its
propriety&mdash;but, as he acted upon delegated authority,
he wished a meeting as full and general as practicable,
of the subscribers to the assemblies to be convened; and
if a majority of them disapproved of the act of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
managers, the invitation to Mr. Burr should be promptly
withdrawn. A meeting, a very full meeting, was called,
and a majority sanctioned the act of the managers. The
ball went on very harmoniously; Col. Burr, though
somewhat distrusted by some, was considered an elegant
acquisition to it, and was treated accordingly: a hospitable
and gracious smile from the ladies, in return for
his very general, and very elegant salutations, proved
their happy acquiescence in the general arrangement.
Gen. Jackson resided about 14 miles from Nashville at
that time: if he and his amiable lady attended on that
occasion, as they often did on others, I have lost all
distinct recollection of it, which I think I should not, if
there had been anything more marked in the attention
of either to Col. Burr than seemed to be generally
awarded to him by the company. While on this subject
I will remark that some time previous to this ball, a
young gentleman who resided in my family in Nashville,
appeared anxious to go with Col. Burr&mdash;he afterwards
cooled off. And questioned on the subject by
myself or someone in my presence, he stated that a
Mr. Caffrey, I think was the name, had been about that
time advised, verbally or by letter, I am not certain
which, by Gen. Jackson, to have nothing to do with
Col. Burr&rsquo;s expedition. Respectfully Th. G. Watkins.&rdquo;

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Burr, on his last visit to Nashville, resided at least
a part of the time at the Clover Bottom tavern, which,
with a store, a race track, and a boat yard, formed the
establishment developed by Andrew Jackson, John
Hutchings, a nephew of Mrs. Jackson, and John Coffee,
who in 1809 married one of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s nieces,
Mary Donelson. It was here that Burr obtained the
boats which brought down such a storm of criticism
upon the head of Jackson. A careful examination of
the orders for boats and related dealings between Jackson
and Burr do not justify the accusation of conspiracy&mdash;particularly
in view of General Jackson&rsquo;s activities in
complying with orders from the Secretary of War regarding
a military force to protect the West against
Burr&rsquo;s anticipated invasion.</p>
<p>After Burr&rsquo;s departure with his two visibly empty
flat-boats, feeling in certain circles began to mount
higher and higher. He was publicly denounced as a
traitor and on January 2, 1807, was burned in effigy
by a group of Nashville&rsquo;s citizens. This event is described
in the <i>Impartial Review</i> of Saturday, January 3,
1807, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Last night at the hour of nine, commenced the
burning of the Effigy of Col. Aaron Burr, by the citizens
of this town. This proceeding is justified by the
ardent emotions of patriotism felt by the people, and
excited by a deep conviction that the said Burr is a
TRAITOR. This conviction is produced from the conduct
of Col. Burr himself in these western states, and
even in this town&mdash;the proclamation of the President&mdash;his
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
message to both houses of Congress, and the statement
of Gen. Eaton. And we have the utmost confidence
in assuring our Atlantic brethren, that the idea
of separation is spurned with indignation and horror.
That our lives and our property are pledged to support
the General Government of the United States, as the
safeguard of our personal security, and as the only
asylum for oppressed humanity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequent events proved that the Burr alarm was
very much of a tempest in a teapot, but the incident
was used, long afterwards, against General Jackson by
his political opponents. Similar use was made of the
Robards&rsquo; divorce and of the tragic story of his duel
with Charles Dickinson.</p>
<p>The log house was the home of the Jacksons at the
time of the Dickinson duel, May 29, 1806; but the scene
of events which led to it was Clover Bottom, the site
of Jackson&rsquo;s race track, store, and tavern, about two
miles from the Hermitage. The direct cause of the
duel was the race between Jackson&rsquo;s celebrated Truxton
and Capt. Joseph Erwin&rsquo;s Ploughboy&mdash;a race which
was arranged in the fall of 1805, but was not run.
Ploughboy&rsquo;s lameness caused his owner to withdraw him
from the race and pay the $800 forfeit. There are a
number of stories about events which followed the withdrawal
of Ploughboy. Judge Guild, in his <i>Old Times
in Tennessee</i>, probably gives the most accurate account
of the matter as it concerns Mrs. Jackson.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been informed,&rdquo; Judge Guild wrote, &ldquo;by a
relative of Mrs. Jackson, a gentleman of high character,
still living, that she was present, in her carriage,
on the track, to witness the race, and when the forfeit
was declared, she remarked with an air of pardonable
exultation, to some of her friends, that &lsquo;Truxton would
have left Ploughboy out of sight.&rsquo; This was repeated
to Dickinson, who, being somewhat excited by his losses,
and probably under the influence of liquor, rejoined,
&lsquo;Yes, about as far out of sight as Mrs. Jackson left her
first husband when she ran away with the General.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was followed by some gentlemen&rsquo;s gossip about
the value of notes put up by Capt. Erwin for the forfeit,
and one incrimination led to another until a situation
which had but one remedy was created. Jackson, by the
repeated insults heaped upon him by the Erwin faction,
was forced to challenge Charles Dickinson to a duel.
Since the laws of Tennessee prohibited dueling, the
meeting was carried across the line into Kentucky,
where, on the morning of May 29, 1806, the duel was
fought. The results are well known. Dickinson, crack
pistol shot of the West, who had left behind him along
the road to the meeting place evidences of his expert
marksmanship, fired&mdash;and the shot entered his adversary&rsquo;s
breast. His opponent fired, but the pistol stopped
at half-cock. With superhuman effort he drew himself
to full height, folded his coat closer across his breast to
hide the wound which he believed fatal, and with cool
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
deliberation took the second fire to which he was entitled.
Dickinson&rsquo;s wound proved fatal and Jackson&rsquo;s very
nearly so, but the bitter enemies who had driven Jackson
into the duel were not satisfied&mdash;they entered upon a
relentless tirade of abuse, and the public, shuddering,
turned its sympathy to the young widow of Dickinson.
Rachel, in her little log house, wept out her own heartache
as she nursed the General back to health&mdash;and
through it all prayed and wept for the young wife of
Charles Dickinson and her unborn babe.</p>
<p>(The first edition of the present work referred to the
Dickinson child as an &ldquo;unborn babe&rdquo;&mdash;a statement
which had long been accepted by Jackson historians.
Charles Dickinson&rsquo;s will in <i>Wills and Inventories of
Davidson County</i>, (1807) pp. 141-142, states, however,
that &ldquo;... half of my Estate I give devise &amp; bequeath
to my son Henry who is now about Ten weeks old ...&rdquo;)</p>
<p>As time passed the wound healed. Jackson retired
to his Hermitage and devoted himself to his business,
his farm, and his blooded stock. Truxton, the innocent
cause of this tragedy, blossomed under the friendly
skies of Tennessee, but neither he nor his master were
destined to remain long in retirement. Life stretched
out temptingly before them, and it was not long until
Truxton was the acknowledged king of the turf, and
upon his master&rsquo;s brow were the laurels won in his defense
of New Orleans.</p>
<p>No history of the Hermitage could be complete without
a rather detailed account of Truxton. He was
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
bought by General Jackson in the spring of 1805 from
Maj. John Verrell, of Virginia. After the first race
with Ploughboy was announced and the forfeit declared,
another race, which is less known, was run and Truxton
was the winner. This race took place on April 3, 1806&mdash;something
over a month before the Dickinson duel.</p>
<p>The best authority on this race and upon Truxton
himself is Andrew Jackson. His statement was written
for the <i>American Farmer</i> and was reprinted in the
<i>American Turf Register</i> of December, 1833. This account
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Truxton is a beautiful bay, full of bone and muscle;
was got by the imported horse old Diomed, and came
out of the thoroughbred mare, Nancy Coleman, the
property of Maj. John Verrell, of Virginia. Truxton
is, however, too well known to require a minute description.
His performances on the turf have surpassed
those of any horse of his age that has ever been run in
the western country; and, indeed, it might be said with
confidence, that he is equal, if not superior, to Mr. Ball&rsquo;s
Florizel horse, who was got by the same Diomed, and
who now stands unrivalled in Virginia as a race horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truxton, by old sportsmen and judges, is admitted
to be amongst the best distance horses they ever run or
had to train. His speed is certainly unknown to all
those who have run against him. He has, on the most
unequal terms, started against the very best mile horses
in Kentucky and Tennessee, and beat them with great
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
ease; and in no one instance has ever run with any
horse, when he himself was in order, but he either could
or did distance him with ease. Although the four mile
heats is the real and true distance for Truxton to run,
he has beaten Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s fine mile horse, Jack of
Clubs, and Mr. Cotton&rsquo;s Greyhound, both aged horses,
with equal weights of 100 pounds on each, the single
mile heats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lastly, to crown the much doubted speed of
Truxton, he beat, on only two sound legs, on the 3d of
April, 1806, over the Clover Bottom Turf, the celebrated
horse, Ploughboy, who was never before beaten,
and beating him without the assistance of whip or spurs.
It is now no longer difficult for the numerous concourse
of people who were present on that day to say &lsquo;whether
or not Truxton be the true bred racer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truxton&rsquo;s winnings, from time to time, from the
most correct information, amount to at least twenty
thousand dollars, and his colts are not inferior to any
on the continent. Andrew Jackson.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truxton was, undoubtedly, Jackson&rsquo;s pride, but the
Hermitage was noted for many famous horses. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
was Pacolet, the dapple gray six-year-old, which the
General had bought from Col. William R. Johnson, of
Kentucky, about 1813. His immediate object in acquiring
a new racer was, according to Marquis James,
in his <i>Andrew Jackson, the Border Captain</i>, to defeat
&ldquo;Jesse Haynie&rsquo;s chestnut mare Maria just as soon as he
could send the British about their business.&rdquo; This
neither Pacolet, nor Truxton&rsquo;s boasted colts could accomplish,
and to Haynie&rsquo;s Maria is awarded the distinction
of being almost the only thing which Andrew
Jackson, when he set his head to it, could not conquer.</p>
<p>To tell the story of Jackson&rsquo;s horses would be to
write the history of racing and breeding of thoroughbreds
from the early days of the settlements in Middle
Tennessee until after the Civil War. There was a close
association between General Jackson and the owners of
thoroughbreds in Sumner County, where, for a long
period of years such men as Bailie Peyton, Barry, Carter,
the Rev. Hardy Cryer and others produced magnificent
horses.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that Andrew Jackson arrived in
Nashville riding one fine horse and leading another&mdash;which
was loaded in the customary manner with his personal
belongings. Early in the spring after his arrival
he purchased another, for we find at the Davidson
County Court House a record showing that on April
ninth, 1789, he bought of Thomas Smith &ldquo;one Sorrell
horse About fourteen hands high known by the name
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
of Sam<sup>l</sup> Martin&rsquo;s Sorrel: Which s<sup>d</sup> Horse the s<sup>d</sup> Smith
purchased from the s<sup>d</sup> Samuel Martin for the consideration
of the Sum of One hundred pounds....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The punctuation of this record is somewhat scant,
but from the general context one gathers that Andrew
Jackson paid one hundred pounds for the Horse, rather
than that Thomas Smith paid this sum to Samuel Martin.
At any rate &ldquo;Samuel Martin&rsquo;s Sorrel&rdquo; was valued
at one hundred pounds&mdash;a rather goodly sum for young
Attorney Jackson to be paying. Throughout his long
life he continued to buy the best horses he could afford&mdash;they
were a passion with him&mdash;and, unlike many
devotees of the turf, he made money, rather than lost
it, in his deals.</p>
<p>One of General Jackson&rsquo;s choice saddle horses was
Duke, who is said to have been his favorite during the
New Orleans campaign. If we credit the story of
Uncle Alfred, the slave who for many years was his
faithful bodyservant, he was mounted upon Duke on
the day of victory. Mrs. Mary C. Dorris, in her <i>Preservation
of the Hermitage</i>, quotes Uncle Alfred as
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson is ridin&rsquo; Juke (Duke) dat day; he
warn&rsquo;t ridin&rsquo; Sam Patch, dat &rsquo;ar white horse standin&rsquo;
in de parlor.... He&rsquo;s ridin&rsquo; Juke. An&rsquo; Juke he
dance Yankee-Doodle on three legs; and he dance it
so plain dat de ban&rsquo; struck up an&rsquo; play &lsquo;Jackson, Jackson,
yer&rsquo;s de man for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>General Jackson, in a letter written to Mrs. Jackson
during the Florida campaign of 1818, shows his affection
for Duke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am advised there are a few red sticks (hostile Indians)
west of Appelachecola, should this be true, I
will have to disperse them, this done I shall commence
my journey home. I am almost on foot, I almost despair
of getting my favourite Old Duke home.&rdquo; (Bassett,
<i>Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</i>, Vol. II.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uncle Alfred referred to the portrait in the Hermitage
parlor, a work of the artist Earl, which shows
General Jackson mounted on the white charger presented
to him by the citizens of Philadelphia. He was
a graceful and daring horseman and, like Washington
and other great generals, had a passion for horses. He
had also a country gentleman&rsquo;s interest in the breeding
of blooded stock, and a sportsman&rsquo;s interest in their
speed and bottom. There came a time, however, when
he was forced to give up the turf&mdash;although never, for
a moment, did he relinquish his interest in the breeding
of fine horses at his Hermitage estate. The severe
criticism of his horse-racing proclivities by his political
enemies caused him, after his elevation to the Presidency,
to discontinue training his colts for the track
at the Hermitage.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>But the log cabin days were ending. Fame came
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
slowly, but certainly, to the humble dwelling in the
midst of the fertile acres of the Hermitage. It was
not sought by the master of the household, and it certainly
was not welcomed by its mistress. It was impossible,
however, for such a dynamic nature as Jackson&rsquo;s
to avoid following an active and forceful course in the
events of the period. He could no more stay at home
when his presence was needed in the field than he could
avoid taking a leader&rsquo;s place when he got into action.
Each event in which he participated led him farther
and farther from the simple life which he and his
household had been leading, for with each success came
promotions which gave the public greater and greater
claims upon him.</p>
<p>The log cabin years, in spite of the struggles and
tragedies sprinkled through them, were, on the whole,
happy and eventful ones. The financial structure of
the Hermitage household was strengthened, the public
affairs of its master prospered, and his personal contacts
with those who disagreed with him became less
violent. Children had always been a part of the household.
Rachel&rsquo;s brothers and sisters lived near by and
their children, from babyhood to maturity, were her
delight as well as General Jackson&rsquo;s. Added to these
were the Butler children who, in the years of 1804 and
1805, became General Jackson&rsquo;s wards. In 1809, when
twin boys were born to Severn Donelson&rsquo;s wife, the
mother was quite frail, so Rachel carried one of her tiny
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
nephews home with her and claimed him for her own.
He was legally adopted and given the General&rsquo;s own
name. After 1813 the Indian boy, Lincoya, orphaned
at the Battle of Talluschatches, was taken into the
friendly shelter of the Hermitage. A great favorite
through the years was Andrew Jackson Donelson, who
grew into a brilliant statesman under the General&rsquo;s
fond care. Another valuable acquisition to the household
was the young artist, Ralph E. W. Earl, who in
1818 married Jane Caffrey, one of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s numerous
nieces.</p>
<p>Among the others who married Rachel&rsquo;s nieces were
Abraham Green, of Natchez, who married Patsey Caffrey
in January, 1801; General John Coffee, who married
Mary Donelson in 1809; William Eastin, who
married Mrs. Coffee&rsquo;s sister, Rachel Jackson Donelson,
in the same year; and John C. McLemore, of Nashville.
General Coffee&rsquo;s daughter, Mary, who as a young lady
was a member of the Jackson household at the White
House, married Andrew Jackson Hutchings, ward and
grand-nephew of General Jackson. Through all the
years the Jackson household knew the happy confusion
which is common to large families&mdash;love, laughter,
tears, and all of the things which go to make life full
and interesting. No one reveled in these relationships
more than the master, whose own near kin had been
snatched from him by a series of tragic incidents of
the Revolutionary War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Mrs. Jackson had not been confined entirely, however,
to her own family circles and the log Hermitage.
After the victory at New Orleans she went south to
join her husband. In the same year she accompanied
him on a visit to Washington and to Virginia, and at
all places she shared with him the honors showered
upon him by an adoring populace. She accompanied
him, too, when he went to Pensacola to assume the office
of Governor of the Floridas, and from these trips returned
laden with gifts and purchases which were somewhat
out of place in the humble quarters to which they
were brought. The time had come, obviously, for the
building of a home more in keeping with the station
of its master. Fortunately his financial status justified
it. Otherwise the family would have undoubtedly remained
in the log dwelling, for Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s good
sense and determination to live within his means far
outweighed any personal vanity. He was solicitous,
however, of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s welfare, and was for her
sake particularly interested in building a more suitable
home.</p>
<p>The new Hermitage was built for Rachel, upon the
spot which she selected. Major Lewis, Parton says,
suggested it be built upon another more elevated site,
but that General Jackson said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, Major, Mrs. Jackson chose this spot, and she
shall have her wish. I am going to build this house
for her. I don&rsquo;t expect to live in it myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>General Jackson&rsquo;s health at this period was even
worse than usual&mdash;and he was seldom well. The one
thought uppermost in his mind when the new house
was built was the comfort of the one person whom he
loved above all other things in the world.</p>
<p>As houses go, the Hermitage of this period was by
no means pretentious. It was a square-looking, home-like
building, made of red bricks manufactured on the
place by the slaves&mdash;spacious, comfortable, and liveable,
but by no means elaborate. Many of the visitors who
were thronging from all parts of the country to visit
the &ldquo;Hero of New Orleans&rdquo; thought it a surprisingly
simple abode for a man of such prominence. It was not,
however, out of keeping with its local setting. Davidson
County, according to the census of 1820, had a population
of only 20,154 people. The section now known
as Middle Tennessee was sparsely settled and still
called &ldquo;West Tennessee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The period of transition from the log cabin to the
ante-bellum mansion had begun, but most of the men
who had fought their way to a financial security which
justified the mansions still remembered their early days
in pioneer cabins. Society was young and unexacting,
and in the West they took Jeffersonian democracy literally.
Andrew Jackson was himself the democrat of
all democrats, but he had a poise and assurance which
made him at home in all companies, and made all
classes of people at ease in his presence. Neither his
manner nor Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s changed, however, with their
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
removal to more handsome quarters. Both of them had
long been known for their gracious hospitality and for
a bearing which was at once simple and dignified.</p>
<p>Thomas Hart Benton, in writing of Mrs. Jackson,
declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She had a faculty&mdash;a rare one&mdash;of retaining names
and titles in a throng of visitors, addressing each one
appropriately, and dispensing hospitality to all with a
cordiality which enhanced its value. No bashful youth,
or plain old man, whose modesty sat them down at the
lower end of the table, could escape her cordial attentions
any more than the titled gentleman on her right
and left. Young persons were her delight, and she
always had her house filled with them&mdash;clever young
women and clever young men&mdash;all calling her affectionately
&lsquo;Aunt Rachel.&rsquo; I was young then, and was one of
that number. I owe it to early recollections and to cherished
convictions&mdash;in this last notice of the Hermitage&mdash;to
bear this faithful testimony to the memory of its
long mistress&mdash;the loved and honored wife of a great
man.&rdquo; (From Benton&rsquo;s <i>Thirty Years&rsquo; View</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Benton who gave to the world the picture of
Andrew Jackson sitting before his fireside in the twilight
with a child and its pet lamb on his knees.</p>

<p class="pcapc">When President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Hermitage in 1907
he alighted from his carriage at the entrance of the avenue and
walked with bared head to the historic old mansion.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>It was for gay groups such as those that Benton mentioned
that the new Hermitage was built. In spite of
the storm and stress the years were passing pleasantly
with its mistress. Fame turned its spotlight upon the
household, but the simple hospitality of the log cabin
period was not abandoned. The spacious rooms of the
new Hermitage rang with the laughter of a great bevy
of nieces, of nephews, and neighbors&rsquo; children. General
Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;military family,&rdquo; friends, and associates
came from here, there, and everywhere, bringing
with them members of their families and staying for
weeks at a time. But the Hermitage acres were broad
and fertile, the slaves were numerous and contented&mdash;and
the mistress an excellent manager.</p>
<p>Years afterwards General Jackson wrote to young
Andrew Jackson Hutchings (letter of April 18, 1833,
Bassett, <i>Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</i>, Vol. V):
&ldquo;Recollect the industry of your dear aunt, and with
what economy she watched over what I made, and how
we waded thro&rsquo; the vast expence of the mass of company
we had. Nothing but her care and industry, with good
economy could have saved me from ruin. If she had
been extravagant the property would have vanished and
poverty and want would have been our doom. Think of
this before you attempt to select a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The years in which this building was occupied were
colorful and eventful ones in the Jackson saga. Unfortunately
little is known of the actual details which
attended its erection, the beginning of the garden, and
other little intimate things concerning it. Even such
a tireless student as the late John Spencer Bassett was
not able to place exactly the time of its completion and
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
occupation. Everything seems to indicate that it was
started in 1818, about the close of General Jackson&rsquo;s
Florida campaign, and that it was ready for occupancy,
most likely, prior to June, 1819, the date of President
Monroe&rsquo;s visit to Nashville and the Hermitage. The
story is being pieced together, bit by bit, and it is gradually
becoming complete.</p>
<p>A letter from Sir John Jackson, mentioned by Bassett,
but secured in full from the manuscripts of the
New York Public Library, by the Tennessee State Library,
shows that in 1819 the Jacksons had secured the
services of an English gardener. This letter reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;Philadelphia, April 30th, 1819.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Genl A Jackson</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear General</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 26th Inst I wrote a few lines to you by William
Frost a regular bred english Gardener who has
been well recommended and from what I can judge from
conversation with him am in hopes he will be found capable
of whatever he undertakes&mdash;I engaged him for you
as Gardener without any stipulation as to terms merely
holding out that on his own capacity and industry his
success and welfare depended&mdash;like others of his situation
of life required an advance to bear his expense and
had to give him 30 dollars on your account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a Nashville paper announcing your arrival
and the congratulations of your Friends and fellow
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
citizens testified by a Public dinner, it seems by the
english Papers the english people are mad with the
Citizens of N. York, this City and Baltimore for the respect
shown you&mdash;with best respects to your Lady I remain
with sincere respect and esteem,
<span class="center">&ldquo;Yours,</span>
<span class="lr">&ldquo;John Jackson.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same connection Bassett quotes a letter to William
B. Lewis, which, though not dated, is placed sometime
in 1819. It reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, Mr. Wilson who was employed by Mr. Decker
to paint my house has disappointed me, he was to have
been here on the 15th he has not arrived. I will therefore
now engage with the gentleman you spoke to me
about, I have a Dearborn waggon in Town to day to
bring up the tubes to convey water from my roof, and
the ballance of the paint. will you have the goodness
to see him for me. get him to go to Mr. Berkmans examine
the bill of paints laid in, and if any wanting to
add them, and to say to Mr. Berkman whether he prefers
the Whitelead in oil or dry, and let it be brought
up to day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be down to day, to ride, but I am taken with
an acute soreness in my left side, I cannot say pain,
that is very troublesome when I bend, or is touched, perhaps
it may with exercise disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard last evening that Mr. Rhea is in town I
wish to see him, and if I can ride without great inconvenience
I will be down for that purpose....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Nashville Whig and Tennessee Advertiser</i>, of
May 15, 1819, carried the announcement that the Hon.
John Rhea was a candidate for Congress from the First
District&mdash;it may have been that he was in Nashville at
the time. The connection between his announcement
and Jackson&rsquo;s letter is somewhat vague, but it may
prove a small link in the chain which will eventually
establish the date of the completion of this building.</p>
<p>Bassett mentions also a receipted bill for china and
silver plate to the amount of $200, dated June 12, 1818,
which, in 1922, was in the possession of Albert M. and
Andrew Jackson, of Los Angeles. This, Jackson&rsquo;s letter
about the paint, and Sir John&rsquo;s letter about the English
gardener, indicate that the Hermitage household
was to be conducted upon a more elaborate scale.</p>
<p>There is a strongly prevalent local tradition that the
artist, R. E. W. Earl, laid out the Hermitage garden.
It is quite possible that he worked with the English
gardener in laying it out. He was established in Nashville
as early as the latter part of the year 1817, for in
the announcement of the Eighth of January Ball, 1818,
some of his portraits were used in the decorations. The
<i>Nashville Whig</i> of January 10, in describing the event,
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Ballroom was decorated with much taste, elegance
and splendor. At the upper end of the room,
were suspended three paintings, the portraits of Generals
Jackson, Carroll and Coffee. Two of which, Generals
Jackson and Coffee, were executed by a young
artist now in this place, which, for boldness of design,
accuracy of execution, judiciousness, and delicacy of
shading would not lose in comparison with the finest
paintings of modern times....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important visitor at the Hermitage that year was
Isaac Shelby, &ldquo;late governor of Kentucky,&rdquo; who stopped
with the Jacksons while he and the General were preparing
to go into the Chickasaw country to hold a treaty.
Both men were popular, and their proposed mission was
important enough to offer a sufficient incentive for an
elaborate public dinner at the Nashville Inn.</p>
<p>At this dinner Col. Edward Ward, president, proposed
the toast: &ldquo;Isaac Shelby, late governor of Kentucky.
The only governor in our Union who, during
our late war, showed himself qualified for both the cabinet
and the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John H. Eaton, Esq., vice president, proposed: &ldquo;General
Jackson, His military greatness commands our admiration&mdash;his
private virtues our esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the generals and their suite were off for the
Chickasaw country. They encountered some difficulty,
for the <i>Nashville Whig</i> of October 10 reported that
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
&ldquo;but four chiefs attended on October 2nd&rdquo;&mdash;they were
alarmed at parting with any of their territory. On
October 19, however, General Jackson wrote the following
letter, announcing a successful conclusion of the
mission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;Treaty Ground, October 19, 1818.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Editors of the Whig:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just closed a treaty with the Chickasaw
Indians, for all their claims in the states of Tennessee
and Kentucky, containing about seven millions of acres,
of the best lands in the western country, and washed
by the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers, for at
least three hundred and fifty miles: for an annuity of
twenty thousand dollars for fifteen years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am respectfully, Your most obedient serv&rsquo;t, Andrew
Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month later, according to a paragraph in the
Whig, the signing of the treaty was celebrated in Nashville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A Tribute of Respect&mdash;A splendid Ball was given
to General Jackson and staff, at the Nashville Inn, last
Evening, in honor of the late Chickasaw Treaty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governor Shelby was not present, but he had found
time to sit for the young artist at the Hermitage. General
Jackson wrote him on November 24:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the 20th the citizens of Nashville and its vicinity
gave myself and Staff a Ball in commemoration of the
late Chickasaw Treaty where I had the pleasure to see
your Portrait suspended at the head of the assembly
room and I was gratified to find that Mr. Earl had been
so fortunate&mdash;for I can with truth say that there never
came from the hands of an artist a better likeness....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earl married Jane Caffrey, niece of Mrs. Jackson,
on May 19, 1818. The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. William Hume. In less than a year the Reverend
Mr. Hume was called upon to perform the sad duty of
preaching her funeral sermon. The <i>Nashville Whig</i>, of
March 13, 1819, carried the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Hodge, assisted by the Rev. Mr.
Hume, will preach the funeral sermon of the late Mrs.
Earle, at the residence of Col. Stockely D. Hays on to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Jackson mothered and comforted the young
man, and from that time, until his death in 1838, the
Hermitage was his home. During the passing of the
years he painted innumerable portraits of General and
Mrs. Jackson, of the various kin, and of prominent visitors
both at the Hermitage and the White House,
where he was also a member of the household&mdash;so much
a member, in fact, that he was dubbed &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s
Painter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>An intriguing, but forgotten, chapter in Earl&rsquo;s history
was discovered by the writer a few years ago in the
April 10th, 1822, issue of the <i>Nashville Whig</i>. A
short article, headed quite casually, &ldquo;Napoleon Buonaparte
and Marshal Ney,&rdquo; announced: &ldquo;Original portraits
of these great men, taken by Mr. Earl, shortly
after the return of Napoleon from the Island of Elba,
were a few days since received and deposited by him in
the Nashville Museum. Judging by his strikingly correct
portraits of Gen. Jackson, of the President of the
United States, of Shelby, of Haywood, and of a number
of others, which likewise grace and ornament the Museum,
we have no hesitation in believing them to be very
exact likenesses....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where are these portraits of Napoleon and Marshal
Ney, taken from life during the brief, but dramatic
&ldquo;one hundred days&rdquo;?</p>
<p>One of the prominent visitors who sat for the young
artist in his early days at the Hermitage was President
Monroe, who visited Nashville and the Hermitage in
June, 1819. The <i>Nashville Whig</i>, of Saturday, July
12, 1819, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The citizens having learned through the committee
that the President had reached the residence of General
Jackson, and that he would dine with them on Wednesday,
last, set out on that day to meet and conduct him
to this place. They met him four miles from town accompanied
by Maj. Gen. Jackson and suite and Brevet
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
Maj. Gen. Gaines. Three miles from town he was received
by a large collection of the Tennessee Volunteers,
armed and dressed as they were when they were in
the several campaigns in which they had been engaged....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reception by this colorful procession which
thronged the highway to the Hermitage to greet General
Jackson and his distinguished guest was but the
beginning of the festivities. A dinner followed at the
Nashville Inn. President Monroe was entertained at
the Nashville Female Academy on Thursday, June 10,
and on the evening of that day the crowning event of his
visit, a ball at the old Nashville Inn, took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A numerous assemblage of elegance and beauty attended,&rdquo;
said the editor of the <i>Nashville Whig</i>. &ldquo;We
have never seen more taste and beauty than was displayed
in arranging the room, or a more numerous and
brilliant assemblage of ladies. The arrangements were
largely creditable to the managers. At the head of the
room was a large transparency exhibiting an Eagle displayed
and encircled in a ray of glory, bearing in his
beak a transparent painting of our Chief Magistrate.
Fronting at the lower end of the room, was suspended
the portrait of Gov. Shelby of Kentucky. On the right
side of the hall was a full length portrait of Maj. Gen.
Jackson, with a distant view of the British encampment
before New Orleans; fronting him were Genls.
Coffee and Carroll. These inimitable paintings (with
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
the exception of the transparency) were executed by our
artist, Mr. Earl; and are highly honourable to the talents
and profession aquirements of that gentleman.
Over the paintings and around the room, were rich and
beautiful festoons of evergreen and roses....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ray of glory&mdash;how the unknown artist of the transparency
depicted it is a matter of conjecture, but the
yellowed pages of the <i>Nashville Whig</i> bear testimony to
its reality. It takes but small imagination to reconstruct
the picture&mdash;men in handsome military uniforms,
ladies in their gay-colored silks, dancing and conversing
in the stately manner of the period, and paying due
homage to the President of the United States and the
Hero of New Orleans. At the Hermitage they found
time, no doubt, to wander about in the moonlit, magnolia-scented
grounds and to stroll along the paths of
the new garden. Rachel, as she played the r&ocirc;le of gracious,
warm-hearted hostess, could not know that a long,
lonely path, illuminated only by the cold rays of fame
stretched before her adored husband, and that she, before
a decade had passed, would rest under the friendly
sod of her garden. Nor could President Monroe foretell
the future of the distinguished soldier at his side. A
great drama, of which the new Hermitage was to be the
chief setting, was beginning.</p>
<p>It was not long until General Jackson was appointed
governor of the Floridas, and he and Rachel moved
their household temporarily to Pensacola.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gen. Jackson and family left town Saturday evening
last in the Steam Boat Cumberland, on his way to
Pensacola,&rdquo; says the <i>Nashville Whig</i> of April 18, 1821.</p>
<p>A little later it stated: &ldquo;Gen. Jackson and family arrived
at Natchez on April 21, on board the Steam Boat
Rapide, having left Cumberland on account of some accident
having happened to her machinery.&rdquo; The journey
was completed in seven days, despite the accident!
From Natchez, New Orleans, Blakely, Montpelier, and
Mobile came echoes of a triumphant and leisurely progress.
But even at that it was several weeks before the
General and his suite were finally established in Pensacola&mdash;the
Spanish governor was inclined to be a bit difficult
about relinquishing his sway.</p>
<p>Rachel, however, did not like Pensacola. To her
friend, Mrs. Eliza Kingsley, she wrote: &ldquo;Believe me,
this country has been greatly overrated.... One acre
of our fine Tennessee land is worth a thousand....
The General, I believe, wants to get home again as much
as I do....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General was not overly pleased with the situation
and, as soon as he was able to settle certain little difficulties,
he was determined to return to his beloved Hermitage.
Marquis James, in his <i>Andrew Jackson, the
Border Captain</i>, writes of this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How peaceful the Hermitage! &lsquo;Our place looks like
it had been abandoned for a season, But we have a cheirful
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
fire for our friends, and a prospect of living at it for
the ... ballance of our lives. I have sent on my resignation
by Doctor Brunaugh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was over, this uncertain adventure into which Andrew
Jackson had been drawn by an unreciprocated
sense of loyalty to the President and a wish to help his
young friends.... Rachel ... and Andrew undertook
to make their home comfortable for the rest of their
days. In the great hall stood seven cases of furniture
and table silver purchased at New Orleans. However
Rachel might deplore the wicked luxury of the complaisant
Creole town there was no denying the comfort of
good French beds. &lsquo;1 Bedstead, of Mahogany, fluted,
$100,&rsquo; was for her own and Andrew&rsquo;s tall south chamber;
likewise &lsquo;1 Matress of fine ticking, $45, 1 moschette
Bar of Muslin, $16, 1 Counterpane knotted, Marseilles,
$24.&rsquo; There was also a new sideboard and something to
fill the decanters....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was dancing in the hallways in these days&mdash;dancing
to the sound of a flute which &ldquo;Old Hickory&rdquo;
himself may have played. Horace Holley, writing
from Nashville on August 14, 1823, to his father, Luther
Holley, Esq., in Salisbury, Connecticut (copy
given to the author by the late Judge John H. De
Witt), related:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have just returned from the Hermitage, ...
The General called upon us in town on the evening of
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
our arrival and he is one of the most hospitable men in
the state. Mrs. Jackson is not a woman of cultivation,
but has seen a great many people, has fine spirits, entertains
well, and is benevolent. She is short in her person
and quite fat. The General is lean and has been in ill
health but is now invigorated and promises to live out
his three-score and ten. He has built him a good brick
house within the last two years and has finished it handsomely.
Mary has taken three views of it in her sketch
book. We looked at all the presents which have been
made to the old warrior in honour of his military
achievements and were gratified not a little.... The
General has papers from most parts of the Union, and
his study is loaded with piles of them. Considerable
company was at his house every day, and our ladies
danced every evening in the entry to the sound of the
flute....&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mary&rdquo; was Mary Austin Holley, author
and cousin of Stephen Austin. Where are the sketches
she made of The Hermitage?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Jackson was content, Mr. James says, and
&ldquo;the measure of his contentment was in proportion to
the sincerity of his resolution to exchange a brilliant
career for a quiet one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His peace was to be short-lived. On December 5,
1823, he took his seat in the Senate of the United
States, to which he had been appointed by the Tennessee
legislature. For six weary months he remained in
Washington and Rachel, with her usual efficiency, kept
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the Hermitage household going. She was busy, for the
little church which the General was building for her and
her pious friends near the Hermitage was being completed.
His letter, written in Washington, January 29,
1824 (which has been presented to the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage
Association by the late Mr. Leland Hume, a descendant
of the Rev. William Hume), states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly happy to hear that our church is about to
be finished, and that pious good man Mr. Hume, is to
dedicate it. If such a mans prayers cannot obtain a
blessing upon the neighborhood, I would despair of the
efficacy of prayer from any other....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The church was completed and the General returned
home&mdash;this time with the avowed intention of carrying
Rachel with him when he returned to Washington the
following autumn. In the meantime the presidential
campaign of 1824 was in full swing, and the Marquis
de Lafayette arrived with his son and suite to be the
&ldquo;nation&rsquo;s guest.&rdquo; On October 18 the distinguished
Frenchman wrote to Jackson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear General, With all the feelings of affectionate
Gratitude I Have Received your kind and
Highly Valued Letter: this is not However the first and
greatest obligation that Binds me to general Jackson;
Had you witnessed my anxiety when on a Sudden all
Europe was pacified, and the flower of the British army
were on their way to Louisiana, you would still Better
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
judge what I felt of relief, joy, and pride, on Receiving
the Glorious Account of your Victory: I Have long Anticipated
the pleasure to take you by the Hand, and
whatever Be your future movements I will Express in
person my High Regard and Sincer friendship....&rdquo;
(Bassett, <i>Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</i>, Vol. III.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Late autumn and winter took the Jacksons to Washington,
where they put up at Gadsby&rsquo;s, which was also
the quarters of the distinguished Lafayette. Here, on
December 23, Mrs. Jackson wrote to her friend describing
the meeting between the famous Frenchman and
General Jackson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are boarding in the same house with the nation&rsquo;s
guest, Lafayette. I am delighted with him....
When we first came to this house, the General said he
would go and pay the Marquis the first visit. Both
having the same desire, and at the same time, they met
on the entry of the stairs. It was truly interesting.
The emotion of revolutionary feeling was aroused in
them both. At Charleston, General Jackson saw him
on the field of battle; the one a boy of twelve, the Marquis,
twenty-three. He wears a wig, and is a little inclined
to corpulency. He is very healthy, eats hearty,
goes to every party, and that is every night....&rdquo;
(From Parton, Vol. II.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachel, too, for that matter was &ldquo;a little inclined to
corpulency.&rdquo; She did not attempt to attend all the parties,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
for Washington was unusually gay and her health
was none too good. She paid calls, received large numbers
of new acquaintances and old friends, and attended,
of course, such important affairs as the eighth of January
ball and Mrs. Monroe&rsquo;s drawing-room.</p>
<p>They stayed in Washington long enough to see General
Jackson miss, by a hairbreadth, becoming President
of the United States and to witness the pomp and ceremony
of Mr. Adams&rsquo; inauguration. They were home
by the latter part of April, ready to take charge of their
household again and to play host and hostess to Lafayette
when he arrived in Nashville on the fourth of May.
Never was there such a celebration!</p>
<p>Twenty-five thousand Tennesseans crowded into
Nashville to welcome him. The military organizations
of the state were out in full force, the ladies wore their
finest dresses, and the streets were decorated with great
triumphal arches of flowers. There were dinners and
public programs of various types, but most important of
all was the ball which was given for him in the Masonic
Hall. Guild, in his <i>Old Times in Tennessee</i>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The dance was opened by Gen. Jackson and the
beautiful Miss McNairy. It was difficult to tell which
was most to admire, the beauty and sylph-like grace of
Miss McNairy, or the stately step and courtly manners
of Gen. Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Thomas Martin, whose narrative is quoted by
Guild, in describing the ball said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old and the young were there, and the scene
was one of beauty, fashion, and smiles. On a dais at
one end of the hall were the guests and the old ladies&mdash;Gen.
Lafayette with Mrs. Rachel Jackson, Gov. Carroll,
with Mrs. Shelby, Gen. Jackson, with Mrs. Priestly and
Mrs. Carroll, George W. Lafayette with Mrs. Stewart
and Mrs. McNairy, and Mr. Shelby with Mrs. Minnick
and myself....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stories of the ball are still recounted with delight in
Nashville, and in many of the old families are fans,
combs, dresses, and the gay little slippers of belles who
&ldquo;danced with Lafayette.&rdquo; But most interesting of all
is the description of Lafayette&rsquo;s reception at the Hermitage,
from the pen of his secretary, M. Levasseur:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At one o&rsquo;clock we embarked with a numerous company
to proceed to dine with General Jackson, whose
residence is a few miles up the river. We there found
numbers of ladies and farmers from the neighborhood,
whom Mrs. Jackson had invited to partake of the entertainment
she had prepared for General Lafayette. The
first thing that struck me on arriving at the General&rsquo;s
was the simplicity of his house. Still somewhat influenced
by my European habits, I asked myself if this
could really be the dwelling of the most popular man in
the United States, of him whom the country proclaimed
one of her most illustrious defenders; of him, finally,
who by the will of the people was on the point of becoming
her Chief Magistrate....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson,&rdquo; Levasseur continues, &ldquo;successively
showed us his garden and farm, which appeared
to be well cultivated. We everywhere remarked the
greatest order and most perfect neatness; and we might
have believed ourselves on the property of one of the
richest and most skillful German farmers, if, at every
step, our eyes had not been afflicted by the sad spectacle
of slavery. Everybody told us that General Jackson&rsquo;s
slaves were treated with the greatest humanity....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this setting Rachel was at her best. She was now
fifty-eight years old. Stout, kindly, motherly, and
frankly growing old; but always the gracious hostess
and always deeply interested in the gay doings of the
young people who were drawn into the charmed circle
of her hospitable household. Her garden had taken
deeper root. Her house was more elegantly furnished
and her acquaintance with the outside world had been
greatly extended; but aside from the fact that she took
her religion a little more solemnly and that she had been
saddened by the malicious attacks made upon her, her
nature had changed but little with the passing years.
She never lost her love of people, her keen interest in
things about her, nor her gentle sympathy.</p>
<p>The famous Frenchman and his entourage had hardly
left when the Hermitage became the gathering place
for a great corps of notables, who entered heart and
soul into the campaign which placed its master in the
President&rsquo;s chair and which completely vindicated its
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
mistress. Never in the history of the nation has such
a bitter, unscrupulous attack been waged against a candidate
for public office; and never, under any circumstances,
has an American woman received such shameful
treatment at the hands of a political party. It is a
page in history which is best overlooked.</p>
<p>However the storms raged on the outside, they did
not change the happy atmosphere of the Hermitage. If
the mistress suffered&mdash;as of course she did&mdash;she kept
up a brave front for the General and the other members
of her household. Henry A. Wise, later governor of
Virginia, who was a guest at the Hermitage of this
period, gives in his <i>Seven Decades of the Union</i>, an interesting
picture of the house itself, as well as the social
life which centered about it. This description is especially
important, for it supplies the only known description
of the interior of the brick house which was erected
in 1819.</p>
<p>Wise had just been married to Anne Jennings,
daughter of the Rev. Obadiah Jennings, Jackson&rsquo;s Presbyterian
minister in Nashville, and the bride and
groom, with their bridal party, had been invited to
spend the honeymoon at the Hermitage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We arrived at the Hermitage to dinner,&rdquo; Wise
wrote, &ldquo;and were shown to a bridal chamber magnificently
furnished with articles which were the rich and
costly presents of the city of New Orleans to its noble
defender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Had we not seen General Jackson before, we would
have taken him for a visitor, not the host of the mansion.
He greeted us cordially and bade us feel at home,
but gave us to distinctly understand that he took no
trouble to look after any but his lady guests; as for the
gentlemen, there were the parlor, the dining-room, the
library, the side-board and its refreshments; there were
the servants, and, if anything was wanting, all that was
necessary was to ring. He was as good as his word.
He did not sit at the head of his table, but mingled with
his guests, and always preferred a seat between two
ladies, obviously seeking a chair between different ones
at various times. He was very easy and graceful in his
attentions; free, and often playful, but always dignified
and earnest in his conversation. He was quick to perceive
every point of word or manner, was gracious in approval,
but did not hesitate to dissent with courtesy
when he differed. He obviously had a hidden vein of
humor, loved aphorism, and could politely convey a
sense of smart travesty. If put upon his mettle he was
very positive, but gravely respectful. He conversed
freely, and seemed to be absorbed in attention to what
the ladies were saying; but if a word of note was uttered
at any distance from him audibly, he caught it by a
quick and pertinent comment, without losing or leaving
the subject about which he was talking to another person&mdash;such
was his ease of sociability, without levity or
lightness of activity, and without being oracular or
heavy in his remarks. He had a great power of attention
and concentration, without being prying, curt, or
brusque. Strong good sense and warm kindness of
manner put every word of his pleasantly and pointedly
in its right place.</p>

Hermitage</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">(Original presented to the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association in 1944
by Mrs. C. W. Frear, of Troy, N. Y., in memory of her husband.)</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;To illustrate him in a scene: The Hermitage house
was a solid, plain, substantial, commodious country
mansion, built of brick, and two stories high. The front
was south. You entered through a porch, a spacious
hall, in which the stairs ascended, airy and well lighted.
It contained four rooms on the lower floor, each entering
the passage and each on either side opening into the
one adjoining. The northwest room was the dining
room, the southeast and southwest rooms were sitting
rooms, and the northeast room had a door entering into
the garden. The house was full of guests. There were
visitors from all parts of the United States, numbering
from twenty to fifty a day, constantly coming and going,
all made welcome, and all well attended to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cost of the coming Presidency was even then
very great and burdensome; but the general showed no
signs of impatience, and was alive and active in his attentions
to all comers and goers. He affected no style,
and put on no airs of greatness, but was plainly and
simply, though impulsively, polite to all. Besides his
own family he had his wife&rsquo;s relatives, Mr. Stokely and
Andrew J. Donelson, around him every day, and his
adopted son, Andrew Jackson, relieved him of all the
minute attentions to guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Lee, of Virginia, was, we may say, resident
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
for the time with him, as he was engaged in writing for
his election some of the finest campaign papers ever
penned in this country. One of Lee&rsquo;s fugitive pieces,
on the death of an Indian youth, the son of a chief who
was killed at the battle of the Horseshoe, whom the general
had taken as a godson, an orphan of one of his victories,
is a precious pearl of poetry in prose. (This refers
to Lincoya and places his death about 1828. Where
is Lee&rsquo;s article on his death? Both the Lee Foundation
and the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association are interested in
finding it.)... He was not as handsome as his half-brother,
General Robert E. Lee....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first or second evening of our stay, Mr. Lee had
drawn around him his usual crowd of listeners; but we
were the more special guests of Mrs. Jackson. She was
a descendant of Colonel Stokely of our native county,
Accomack, Virginia, and we had often seen his old
mansion, an old Hanoverian hip-roofed house, standing
on the seaside, not far above Metompkin; and she had
often heard her mother talk of the old Assawaman
Church, not very far above Colonel Stokely&rsquo;s house,
pulled down long before our day, endowed with its silver
communion-service by our grandfather, George Douglas,
Esq., of Assawaman. Thus she was not only a good
Presbyterian too, but the groom was from the county of
her ancestors, in Virginia, and could tell her something
about the traditions she had heard from which she
sprung....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>When there is added to Wise&rsquo;s description of the interior
of the Hermitage of this period the view of the
building and grounds included in Earl&rsquo;s 1831 portrait
of General Jackson, the picture of the house as it was
from 1819 to 1831 is complete. The <i>Nashville Republican</i>
and <i>Tennessee Gazette</i>, on Thursday, August 25,
1831, repeated a criticism of this portrait which had appeared
in the <i>Washington Globe</i>.</p>
<p>It reads, in part: &ldquo;The artists of Boston announce it
a &lsquo;first rate work,&rsquo; and the intimate friends of the President
consider it the most perfect likeness ever taken of
him. It is not only recommended by this circumstance,
but it is rendered doubly interesting as a sort of historical
picture, in which the taste and talent of the designer
is, in high degree manifested. The President
stands alone in the solitude of the Hermitage. The
scene is most accurately delineated. The house and surrounding
grounds, although thrown somewhat in the
distance, are identified to all acquainted with the spot,
by its most striking features....&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the west is seen a small square building which may
have been used by General Jackson as an office. There
is a tradition that it was Earl&rsquo;s studio and, since the
artist was a member of the household in 1818 and 1819,
it is more than likely true. There is a remote possibility
that it was the kitchen, for the dining room, according
to Wise&rsquo;s description, was &ldquo;the northwest room,&rdquo; but it
is more probable that the old kitchen was located near
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the present one, on the north side of the building.
(Since 1933 a brick building, in the style of the period,
has been erected on this foundation.) Traces of the
foundation of this small building are still visible. It is
important to observe further in this portrait which, in
1831, was accepted by the public and Nashville and in
Washington as a historically accurate view of the Hermitage,
there was still no evidence of the famous cedar-lined,
guitar-shaped drive.</p>
<p>This portrait, which from an historical standpoint is
probably the most important of the Jackson portraits,
was presented to the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association in
1944 by Mrs. Charles W. Frear, of Troy, New York, in
memory of her husband. For many years the Association
did not know the location of the original, although
it had long used a reproduction in its catalogue which,
it appears, had been given to the organization about
1901 by McClure&rsquo;s Magazine. It is interesting that
the acquisition of this famous portrait by the Ladies&rsquo;
Hermitage Association was perhaps due, in part, to the
interest of a member of the artist Earl&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Mr. Ralph Earl Prime, Jr., of Yonkers and New
York City, New York, writing to the author on October
8th, 1936, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have borne in mind your interest in the 1831 portrait
of Gen. Jackson with the Hermitage as a background,
which was painted by Ralph E. W. Earl. I followed
up the clue afforded by the article in the issue of
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
McClure&rsquo;s Magazine in 1897, to which you called my
attention, with the result that I have just received a letter,
of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In reply to your letter of October 2, 1936, with
reference to portrait of Andrew Jackson painted by
Ralph E. W. Earl, will say the portrait was for many
years in possession of the late Wm. H. Frear. It is now
in my possession. The information you have in regard
to the portrait is substantially correct to the best of my
belief. Yours very truly, C. W. Frear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he (Mr. Frear) could visit the Hermitage in person,&rdquo;
Mr. Prime continued, &ldquo;as I and some of my
friends have done with so much satisfaction, and catch
the spirit which actuates its custodians, I am sure that
he would realize how appropriate it would be to restore
the painting to its former setting as a gift to posterity,
either presently or by his will....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily, through Mrs. Frear&rsquo;s generosity, this treasure
has been restored to <i>The Hermitage</i>, where it will
remain through the years as a memorial to her husband.</p>
<p>This was Rachel Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage&mdash;the Hermitage
in which she entertained Monroe, Lafayette, and all
that gay and distinguished company which, as stars in
the great Jackson constellation, were destined, for a
time, to dazzle the nation. And how many of them had
known the kindly hospitality of the mistress of the Hermitage
... the quiet, studious, James K. Polk, who
as &ldquo;young Hickory&rdquo; was to carry the Jackson banner
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
again to the president&rsquo;s chair; Sam Houston, gay, lovable,
and erratic, who was to be president of the Lone
Star Republic; &ldquo;Jeff&rdquo; Davis, future president of the
Confederate States of America; Thomas Hart Benton,
destined to a powerful career in the United States Senate;
John Eaton, John Coffee, William Carroll, and a
score of others who shared the Jackson military and civil
honors. All of them spent happy days under her roof
and all of them, at some time during their career, took
time to pay public tribute to her beloved memory.</p>
<p>As the year of 1828 drew to a close General Jackson&rsquo;s
victory was assured. There was no personal elation in
it for Rachel, however, just as there was no bitterness
toward her persecutors during their most severe attacks
upon her. Her reply when news of victory was brought
to the Hermitage was: &ldquo;For Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s sake, I am
glad; for my own part, I never wished it. I had rather
be a doorkeeper in the House of my Lord than to live in
that palace in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had always preferred the quiet of her own home
and had resented the demands which fame made upon
her husband. Her friends, though, were greatly elated
for her sake, as well as for the General&rsquo;s. John H.
Eaton, writing her from Washington, December 7,
1828, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The storm has now abated&mdash;the angry tempest has
ceased to howl. A verdict by the American people has
been pronounced of that high and grateful character,
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
that for the honor of your husband, you cannot but look
back upon the past as an idle fading vision carrying
in it nothing substantial&mdash;nothing that should produce
to you one moments feeling, or a moments pain. No
man has ever met such a triumph before.... The
Ladies from distance&mdash;from remote parts of the Union
will be here&mdash;brought essentially and altogether on your
account and to manifest to you their feelings and high
regard: they will be present to welcome and congratulate
you....&rdquo; (Bassett, Vol. III p. 449.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nashville ladies were already busy doing their part
to honor her&mdash;they were preparing a handsome wardrobe
for her to carry to Washington with her, and the
entire town was arranging a magnificent celebration
for December 23, the anniversary of the night battle
at New Orleans. Jackson leaders in Washington,
Philadelphia, and other important places were preparing
elaborate programs honoring the president-elect
... but on December 22 the rejoicing was turned into
mourning. Rachel Jackson quietly slipped beyond the
reach of cruel tongues.</p>
<p>Her illness came suddenly and unexpectedly a few
days before the anticipated celebration. There are
many versions of its origin. Some say that while in
Nashville she was resting at the Nashville Inn and
accidentally overheard some unpleasant remarks about
her part in the past campaign. Others carry the story
still farther and say that she wept and that, in returning
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
to the Hermitage, she stopped her carriage at a
creek to bathe her swollen eyes, and thus caught a
cold. There could have been little shock connected with
anything which she may have overheard, for she had
been familiar with the attacks made on her throughout
the past campaign. One thing which may be accepted
as certain is that in some way she caught cold. Wise
quotes a young Dr. Heiskell, of Winchester, Virginia,
who was just starting as a physician in the neighborhood,
and was the first doctor to reach her, as saying:
&ldquo;We learned that she had caught cold and pleuritic
symptoms supervened upon her constitutional nervous
affections. She was sitting smoking her corncob pipe
when she caught her last malady....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wise further explains that &ldquo;a pipe was prescribed
by her physician for her phthisis, and she often rose in
the night to smoke for relief.&rdquo; Whatever the explanation
of the pipe may be, its only importance was its use
in the caricatures used by her husband&rsquo;s opponents in
the presidential campaign. She had long been subject
to the bronchial trouble which was, undoubtedly, the
chief cause of her death.</p>
<p>No words can describe the tragedy which stalked at
the Hermitage during her illness. The General would
not leave her side. The servants stood about in stricken
silence, with the exception of old Hannah, who nursed
her, and the few who were allowed to perform little
duties to assist her. Friends and relatives gathered&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
on the late afternoon of the twenty-second her
condition seemed greatly improved. She had persuaded
General Jackson to lie down on a sofa in the
next room in order that he might be rested for the
coming celebration&mdash;which, she insisted, he must attend.
He obeyed and Mrs. Jackson was removed from
her bed that it might be prepared for the night. As
she sat in a chair, supported by the arms of the faithful
Hannah, she suddenly uttered a cry and her head fell
forward.... The General rushed to her and for a
time, neither he nor his stricken household would believe
that she was dead. At his command they placed her
upon a table, the physician made an effort to bleed her,
and they worked with her for hours before the desperate
old man could understand that there was no hope. All
night he remained by her side.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the twenty-third the citizens
of Nashville were informed of her death. It was ordered
that on the following day, from one until two
o&rsquo;clock, the hour set for her funeral, that the church
bells be tolled. The scene was rapidly changed from
one of festivity to deep mourning, and on the next
day the road was crowded with people on their way
to the Hermitage to pay their last respects to a sainted
woman. The Reverend William Hume preached her
funeral sermon.</p>
<p>A gentleman from Philadelphia who was present
wrote to a relative:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such a scene I never wish to witness again. The
poor old gentleman was supported to the grave by General
Coffee and Major Rutledge. I never pitied any
person more in my life. The road to the Hermitage
was almost impassable, and an immense number of persons
attended the funeral. The remains were interred
in the lower part of the garden. I never before saw
so much affliction among the servants in the death of a
mistress. Some seemed completely stupified by the
event; others wrung their hands and shrieked aloud.
The woman who had waited on Mrs. Jackson had to be
carried from the ground....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The funeral service was, in fact, delayed because she
had thrown herself upon her mistress&rsquo; grave and refused
to move. General Jackson would not allow her
to be torn away by force, but waited patiently until her
associates could persuade her to allow them to remove
her.</p>
<p>So ended all thoughts of victory for Andrew Jackson.
All that had made victory sweet, all that had
made life worth while, had passed away. The only
thing to which the broken old man looked forward was
his return to their beloved Hermitage. His body, his
mind, and his indomitable will he carried to Washington&mdash;but
his heart he left buried with Rachel in their
garden.</p>
<p>Although for a time after her death Rachel Jackson&rsquo;s
Hermitage&mdash;the building as it appeared from 1819 to
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
1831&mdash;remained unchanged, the period was, to all intents
and purposes, ended. The household and its followers
centered about the White House, and the lonely
resting place of its mistress was left to the tender care
of relatives and the slaves whose grief was still inconsolable.
General Coffee, R. E. W. Earl, Andrew
Jackson Donelson and his wife, Emily, who was for a
time mistress of the White House; Andrew Jackson,
Jr., and later his bride, Sarah York Jackson; Major
Lewis, and others formed a part of the household.
Some of the time three Marys&mdash;Mary Coffee, Mary
McLemore, and Mary Eastin&mdash;daughters of Rachel&rsquo;s
nieces, added gayety to the Washington household.
Mary Eastin was married in the White House to Lucius
Polk, and Mary Coffee married General Jackson&rsquo;s ward,
Andrew Jackson Hutchings.</p>
<p>A new phase in the history of the Hermitage began
in 1831. Andrew Jackson, Jr., married the beautiful
and cultured Miss Sarah York, of Philadelphia, on November
24, 1831. Some interest in the future began
to live in the heart of Andrew Jackson. Since his
wife&rsquo;s death he had contemplated his son&rsquo;s marriage
with more than ordinary concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend in May, 1829, &ldquo;the only
hope by which I look to a continuation of my
name....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved to be more than that for it was the beginning
of a beautiful relationship destined to last
from the time he welcomed Sarah York Jackson, as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
bride, to the White House, until she stood at his deathbed
at the Hermitage in 1845. The President, because
of pressing duties and ill health, had not been able to
make the journey to Philadelphia to attend the wedding,
but he sent Col. Earl with a cluster of pearls for the
bride. It was in the form of a ring, and there was a
lock of his hair on the under side of the setting. With
it he sent the message that from his son&rsquo;s description
of her he thought &ldquo;pearls the most fitting gift, as
emblematic of the purity of her character and the beauty
of her face.&rdquo; (From the notebook of Mrs. Rachel Jackson
Lawrence&mdash;State Library.)</p>
<p>The wedding took place at the home of Mrs. Samuel
Wetherill, Sarah York&rsquo;s sister, who lived on Chestnut
Street, in Philadelphia. Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Wetherill,
and another sister, Mrs. Adams, were left orphans in
early childhood, and, at the request of their dying
father, were cared for and educated at Mrs. Malland&rsquo;s
boarding school. They were well-bred, charming, and
well connected. Andrew Jackson himself&mdash;and he was
a noted matchmaker&mdash;could not have made a better
choice for the future mistress of the Hermitage.</p>
<p>Before Andrew Jackson, Jr., brought his bride to the
red brick mansion in Tennessee, extensive remodeling
was done. This period in the history of the Hermitage
had been completely overlooked until a letter in the
Hermitage collection was recently brought to light.
This letter (Published for the first time in the 1933
edition of the present work) which is quoted in full,
gives complete data on the remodeling of the Hermitage
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
in 1831, as well as the building of the tomb in the
garden. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;Nashville, December 6, 1831.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir: I have the satisfaction to inform you
that the additions and improvements to the Hermitage
are compleated. I have in addition to the improvements,
as exhibited on the plan furnished you a neat and
appropriate Portico on the back side of the center
building, which adds very much to the comfort &amp; convenience
of your dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hermitage as improved presents a front of
104 feet, the wings project 9 feet in front the center
building and are connected by a colonnade of the same
breadth. The colonnade consists of 10 lofty columns
of the Doric order the entablature is carried through
the whole line of the front, and has wreaths of laurel
leaves in the frieze, on the cornice is a blocking corse
that support an appropriate balustrade. The upper
story consists of a Portico surmounted by a pediment
which breaks the monotony of the composition in a
very satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The material employed in the emprovements are all
of the best quality the neighborhood affords, the colonnade
is covered with the best copper the sheets weighing
from 12 to 14 lbs. each sheet, and the gutters that
convey the water from front to back are also of copper.
The wing buildings and Porticos are roofed with good
ceader shingles. The old Kitchen is removed and the
matereals employed in the erection of a large and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
comodeus smoke house which is placed on a line with
the new kitchen. The internal arrangements are almost
to my mind. The dining room is large and will dine
100 persons at one time comfortable. The wing at the
East end contains the library a large and comodeous
room and overseer room, and a covered way that protects
the three doors leading to the library the overseer
room and to the back parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the progress of the emprovements I adhered as
closely to the plan furnished you as circumstances would
admit. The only alteration I have made is in adding
2 feet to the length of the Kitchen, and 20 feet to the
length of the East wing. The latter was done at the
request and with the advice of Gen. Coffee which additions
I hope will meet with your approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is the amount that has been expended
independent of what has been done by your one (own)
hands&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perceive by this amount notwithstanding
the several additions, the back Portico, and many additional
expenses incident to such emprovements I have
been able to effect it with a less sume than the original
estimate which to me is a source of gratulation without
respect to any hope of pecuniary emolument. I must
entreat you to believe that no such sordid matire entered
into my views. To merit your approbation has
been my ambition, to succeed in obtaining it is my best

dollars from Mr. Josiah Nicholl, making two thousand
dollars, leiving a ballance of Four hundred and eighty-eight
Dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On receipt of your letter of the 18th August for
which I return you my thanks for the expressions of
kindness it contains, I employed an expereanced stone-cutter
in whome I have entire confidence who is progressing
with the Temple &amp; Monument it will be
composed intire of stone. The massivenes of the parts
of the Grecian Doric order require a material of great
strength such as the white stone of this neighborhood
and when this can be obtained it must always be a subject
of regret that recourse should be had to any imitation
of it however exact: but I found it impossible
to get ceader timber large enough to be wrought into
the forms required. The principle cost of this substantial
and highly ornamental emprovement consists
of the hire of stone cutters, and the purchase of copper
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
for the covering of the doom. I expect in the progress
of this work to have the ade of your one hands &amp; teems
in quarry &amp; halling the stone, which will enable me to
bestoe an additional quantity of labor on the building,
in order that it may fully meet publick expectation.
I am anxious to have it finished as soon in the spring
as possible, in as much as I will be necessary detained
hear to direct the operation of the workmen in order
that it may be in conformity to the plan furnished you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made a drawing of the Hermitage as emproved,
which is in the hands of an experanced engraver,
it will make a splendid picture and as soon as
it is finished I will send you a copy which will give
you a better idea of the building than any written
discription I can give&mdash;my best respects to your son&mdash;Mrs.
M joins with me in tendering you, not our complements,
but our kindest &amp; best wishes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your most obldge

</blockquote>
<p>Notes in Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s own hand on the back of
the letter read: &ldquo;Mr. Morrison rec&rsquo;d &amp; answered. A
bill for $300 inclosed to Mr. Morrison or Josiah Nichol.
A. J. To be preserved. A. J.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture which Mr. Morrison mentioned has been
preserved. It appears on Ayres&rsquo; Map of Nashville,
which was published in 1832. An announcement of
the plans for this map appeared in the <i>Nashville Republican</i>
and <i>State Gazette</i>, of December 6, 1831&mdash;strangely
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
enough, the exact date of Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s
letter. This notice reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Map of Nashville&mdash;Sketches of the embellishments
which are to be attached to this work have been politely
submitted to our inspection. They consist of three
different views of the City&mdash;one from the bank of the
Cumberland near the ruins of the Old Steam Mill;
another from a hill on the South near the residence of
Dr. Overton, and the third from a commanding height
about two miles to the North&mdash;the Penitentiary from
an iminence in front, with its beautiful back-ground
scenery of hill and wood and cultivated field&mdash;a portion
of College Street including Yeatman and Woods&rsquo; Bank&mdash;the
U.S. Branch Bank&mdash;a group consisting of the
Court House, Inn and Hotel&mdash;a part of the Public
Square including the upper end of the Market House&mdash;the
University and background&mdash;the Presbyterian, the
Baptist, and the Episcopal churches&mdash;the Female Academy
and other buildings in the neighborhood. To these
is added a view of the Hermitage in its present newly
finished state, than which there is not to be found west
of the Allegany a more beautiful and splendid private
residence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comparison of the engraving on Ayres&rsquo; map with
Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s letter proves the authenticity of the
picture. There are ten columns instead of the six
stately ones of the present, and the exterior of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
building corresponds in other details with his description.
The tomb, for the artist&rsquo;s convenience, more than
likely, is placed nearer the house than it is in reality.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Baker, present caretaker of the Hermitage,
who has made a careful study of the building,
points out a number of irregularities in the doors of
the east wing which are due, undoubtedly, to the remodeling.
The brick walls themselves show where
the east wing was added and where there was once a
little roof or porch extending over the entrance to the
cellar. The kitchen and smoke-house, as Morrison&rsquo;s
letter states, are on line with each other.</p>
<p>The handsome remodeled Hermitage which was Mr.
Morrison&rsquo;s and Nashville&rsquo;s pride was destined, however,
to a career of short duration. In October, 1834,
it caught fire and was, with the exception of the dining-room
wing and its sturdy brick walls, destroyed. The
catastrophe is described in the <i>Nashville Republican</i> of
October 14, 1834, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Hermitage Burnt&mdash;Yesterday evening about
4 o&rsquo;clock the roof of the Hermitage was discovered to
be on fire, and all attempts to arrest the progress of
the flames proving unavailing, the entire edifice, with
the exception of the room attached to the northern end
and used as a dining room, was in a few hours consumed.
The valuable furniture in the lower story was
fortunately saved, though much broken and otherwise
injured in getting it out. That in the second story was,
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
we understand, chiefly destroyed. The fire is supposed
to have been communicated to the roof by the falling of
a spark from one of the chimneys, and there being a
breeze from the northwest, the progress of the flames
was proportionably rapid. The numerous and valuable
private papers of the President were probably all preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need not add that the event has occasioned to
this community deep and universal regret.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letters from Bassett&rsquo;s <i>Correspondence of Andrew
Jackson</i>, give further details of the fire. On October
14, 1834, Col. Robert Armstrong, Nashville&rsquo;s postmaster,
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Genl. Your son and Majr. Donelson have
both written you the perticulars of the unfortunate
burning of the Hermitage House. We heard the news
Last evening but not the extent of the Damage. I sent
One of the Young men Out of the Office up After supper
who returned by Sun up this morning. I learned
from Majr. D. and the Young man I sent up that all
the furniture and valuables with the papers, letter
Books, etc., have been with the exception of some furniture
upstairs (the Wardrobe and Large bedstead)
saved. Some few things were singed in getting out
but on the whol I expect everything was done that
could be done and I have no doubt it was purely accidental.
The House can be rebuilt on the Old Site for
$2,000 or 2,500. The dineing room wing is but Little
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
injured. I will go up this evening to see your Son and
also Mr. Rife, the Carpenter doing Majr. D. work, and
the one who built my House and will write you in a
day or two. I will see what will be his estimate and
Austins for its Complete Rebuilding and inform
you....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stockley Donelson, General Jackson&rsquo;s nephew, wrote
on the same day, giving details of the fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A fire was kindled in the old dining room,&rdquo; he
stated, &ldquo;and the chimney caught on fire, which not being
observed immediately, and the wind being from
the North west, the fire was communicated to the roof.
The flame however had not spread very far before it
was discovered by Squire and Charles and the alarm
given. Cousin Sarah at this moment was in the house
having just returned from a short ride and Andrew
was in the field, but a short distance from the House,
The fire was soon discovered by Wm. Donelson hands
who were working near at hand, by A. J. Donelson
work men and hands, as well as by your own hands.
They were all on the ground before the roof fell in,
etc. Mr Rife by his own exertions succeeded in getting
on the dining Room roof and extinguishing the flames,
etc. Others were employed in getting out the furniture,
etc., which was nearly all saved, except some
bedsteads up stairs.... Cousin Sarah acted with
firmness and gave every necessary direction to save the
furniture, and Her and Andrew though much Hurt, I
am happy to add bear the misfortune with fortitude.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Col. Armstrong, after his promised visit, wrote:
&ldquo;The dineing room Wing is but Little injured and I
view it this way that you have now the Stone and Brick-work
of your House done, and one Wing Compleate,
and that 2500$ will Compleate the main house and the
other office Wing. The Kitchen and out Houses are
all safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like most estimates, Col. Armstrong&rsquo;s proved to be
far lower than the final cost. The first estimate made
by Joseph Rieff and William C. Hume amounted to
$3,950. Added to this was $239 &ldquo;for Extra work done
upon change of Plan;&rdquo; $186, &ldquo;for work done on West
wing and New Kitchen finding everything;&rdquo; and $750
&ldquo;for the full length two story Porch added finding
every thing;&rdquo; making a grand total of $5,125.</p>
<p>Among the interesting items included in the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
estimate were: &ldquo;1 Circular stair case 2 storys high,
$260; first story of front poarch with 6 collums etc,
$256; second story of ditto, $75; one back Portico,
$40....&rdquo; (Complete details of the rebuilding are
found in Bassett&rsquo;s <i>Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</i>,
Vol. V.)</p>
<p>A new house called, of course, for new furnishings.
Sarah York with the adored little Rachel, born November
1, 1832, and her infant brother, Andrew, went on
to visit the General at the White House. On this visit
Sarah went on to Philadelphia to visit her own kin and
while there made selections for the paper and the furnishings
of the Hermitage.</p>
<p>One of the hitherto unpublished letters of the Hermitage
collection, written at Washington April 14,
1835, by General Jackson, shows his interest in the
furnishings, as well as his tender solicitude for Sarah
York and the children:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sarah: When you get a little rested from
your journey make enquiry about the bedsteads and let
me know at what the eight can be procured, of good
plain mahogany.... I shall be anxious to hear from
you, how my dear little Rachel is, as well as yourself
and Andrew&mdash;I have great solicitude about my dear
little Rachel. Keep the dear little ones for me&mdash;present
me kindly to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wetherall and accept a
father&rsquo;s prayers for your health and happiness. We
all salute thee kindly. Andrew Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Sarah busied herself with shopping and soon she had
purchased a splendid new outfit for the Hermitage.
The bill, dated January 2, 1836 (<i>Correspondence of
Andrew Jackson</i>, Vol. V.) included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 Mahogany Bedsteads, including the packing at 40,

shipments made on the boats, Bonnaffe, Mile, and Jno
Sergeant, amounted to $1,364.50.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was trouble about the wall paper, and again
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
General Jackson&rsquo;s friend, Col. Armstrong, came to the
rescue. He wrote, on May 27, 1836 (Bassett&rsquo;s <i>Correspondence</i>,
Vol. V.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Genl. I send you inclosed a note addressed
to me by the Mess. Yeateman after a conversation I had
with them this morning. They have always been
ready and willing to do all in their power to get back
the paper from those who purchased it. When I call&rsquo;d
on Campbell I expected to get the paper, that night he
cut it and put it on the Walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Williams is not at home. I saw Shelly who will do
nothing in it, he is not disposed to restore it. Williams
<i>dare</i> not, as his wife claims it, so I call&rsquo;d on the Mess.
Yeateman and stated the facts who willingly proposed
to purchase another set....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has long been a tradition in Nashville that
the old Campbell house, not far from town, on the
Lebanon Pike, had paper like that in the Hermitage
hall, but it was, evidently, destroyed when the walls
were scraped and re-papered. Further details concerning
the determined woman who kept the paper have
not, at the present writing, come to light.</p>
<p>A bill dated May 30, 1836, shows that Jackson&rsquo;s merchant
and personal friend, Henry Toland, of Philadelphia,
arranged for another shipment of paper. This
bill includes the items: &ldquo;3 Views of Telemachus at
$29, $87; 7 ps Pannell Paper, at $2.50, $17.50; 7 ps.
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Bordering, at $3.00; $21; 4 ps. Plain Blue, at .75, $3.&rdquo;
A box cost fifty cents and five per cent was deducted
because of the cash payment, making the final amount
$122.60. The bill is marked &ldquo;Received payment fr H
Toland, October 25th 1836. Robert Golder, per Jas.
Cameron Golder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy McClelland, in her monumental work, <i>Historic
Wall-Papers</i>, (Lippincott Company, Philadelphia,
1924) states that &ldquo;the complete set consisted of 25
strips in colours, and the scenes are constructed on the
account of the adventures of Telamachus.&rdquo; It was
manufactured in Paris by Dufour about 1825 and,
though rare, was not an exclusive pattern. It is still
found on the walls of certain historic homes and in a
few private and public collections.</p>
<p>According to the late Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence,
daughter of Sarah York and Andrew Jackson, Jr., the
Telemachus paper now on the walls of <i>The Hermitage</i>
hallway is the third set of its kind purchased by General
Jackson. The first, she declared, was put on the walls
at the time of the remodelling in 1831 and was burned
in the fire of 1834. The second was the one acquired
by Mrs. Campbell and the third, which, like the others,
is the work of Dufour, was placed on the walls some
time after it was ordered in the late spring of 1836.</p>
<p>Sarah York selected papers for the Hermitage, but,
as his letter of April 14, 1835, (Hermitage MSS.
Collection) shows, President Jackson took a personal
interest in the Telemachus paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rec&rsquo; a note from Mr. Toland,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;after you
left us, informing that Mr. South had forwarded the
order to Paris for the Telamucus and the other would
be detained until you arrived and made the selection
for those rooms not selected for. As soon as you can attend
to this and have the selection made and the paper
shipped for New Orleans so that it may get up to Nashville
before the Steam boats stop running. I have
written Mr. Toland on this subject....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eighteen packages of furniture for the Hermitage
were lost when the steamer <i>John Randolph</i> was burned
at Nashville, May 16, 1836, but it is evident that they
were replaced as quickly as possible. There was always,
however, the delay of waiting for sufficiently high
water, in addition to the long, tedious journey around
the coast to New Orleans and up the Mississippi, Ohio
and Cumberland to Nashville.</p>
<p>Another large bill of furnishings for the Hermitage
was purchased of Barry and Krickbaum, of Philadelphia,
in February, 1837. It included 1 Large Wardrobe,
$75; 2 dressing Bureaus to match, $110; 2 Wardrobes,
french pattern, $120; 1 Eliptic front Bureau, $5;
1 Secy and Bookcase complete, $50; 2 pier tables, marble
tops, $120; 1 Work table Elegantly fitted up, $50;
1 Work Stand, marble tray top, $5; 2 Work Stands,
marble tray top, $50; 1 Marble Slab, $10. Total $665.</p>
<p>About the same time a long list of smaller furnishings
amounting to $481.93 was bought of Lewis Veron
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and Company, Philadelphia. There were fenders, and
irons, screens and such, things. Among them were &ldquo;2
Pair french And Irons $70; 1 Gall&eacute;rie for fire place,
$55; 1 Clock Shade and Stand, very large, $17; 1
Plated Egg Boiler, $19; and one Silver Mounted Butter
Tub, $12.&rdquo; (The list is given in full in Bassett&rsquo;s <i>Correspondence</i>,
Vol. V.)</p>
<p>The new furnishings, with such as were left from
the fire, were assembled in a harmonious whole toward
the end of General Jackson&rsquo;s second term as President.
Sarah York, after her arrival at the Hermitage in 1832
had bought carpets, linens, and various necessities.
General Jackson had written his son at this time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah writes me about a Carpet for the dining room
and some table linnen and common furniture for the
Table. There were abundant supply. of table linnen,
etc. etc. when we left the Hermitage, but I suppose it
must have gone the same way as the sheets. I have
said in my letter to Sarah inclosed that a carpet must
be bought for the dining room. There is always a
supply of the carpets made by the Shakers, to be had
at Mr. Nichols, and she must buy such furniture as
the House wants, having an eye to proper economy.
This you will have done agreeable to her directions. I
have named domestic carpet, as it will be cheaper and
better than an oil cloth or matt....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he wrote: &ldquo;View those East India matts or
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
carpeting and see whether these recommended by Mr.
Toland will answer better for the passage than oil
cloth, and whether Sarah would prefer these to common
carpets for the bedrooms....&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all the delays and the characteristic confusion
of moving the furnishings&mdash;old and new&mdash;were at last
arranged. A weary old man&mdash;ill and hemorrhaging
heavily from the lungs&mdash;turned his face eagerly to the
spot which, in all the world, he loved best. To Nicholas
P. Trist he wrote on March 2, 1837, &ldquo;Your letter ...
found me confined to my room, indeed, I might say to
my bed, and I have been only four times down stairs
since the 15th of Novb. last, altho I have been obliged
to labour incessantly.... Tomorrow ends my official
carier forever, on the 4th I hope to be able to go to
the capitol to witness the glorious scene of Mr. Van
Buren, once rejected by the Senate, sworn into office....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in December, 1936, he had written Andrew
Jackson Donelson, a letter of condolence&mdash;the spirited
Emily, whom he loved deeply, but whom he, in high
dudgeon, had sent home because she refused to receive
the much-discussed Peggy O&rsquo;Neal Timberlake Eaton,
had succumbed to a lung trouble similar to that from
which he was suffering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have this moment recd. the sad and melancholy
intelligence that our Dear Emily is no more.... I
have no language in which I can express my grief....
My health is slowly returning, and my strength improving
slowly....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="480" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Garden and the Tomb</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Upon the tomb is carved General Jackson&rsquo;s immortal tribute to his wife: &ldquo;Her face was fair, her person
pleasing, her temper amiable, her heart kind; she delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow creatures,
and cultivated that divine pleasure by the most liberal and unpretending methods; to the poor she was a
benefactor; to the rich an example; to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous an ornament; her piety
went hand in hand with her benevolence, and she thanked her creator for being permitted to do good. A being
so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor. Even Death, when he bore her from
the arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of her God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The rest, sunlight, and pleasant atmosphere of the
Hermitage were destined, however, to work a great improvement.
His wiry, long-suffering body was to recover
sufficiently for him to spend eight years in his
new home before he was laid to rest in the garden beside
the beloved Rachel. During these years his young
men, under his wise guidance, had a tremendous influence
in the nation&mdash;and in 1845, James K. Polk,
who had openly conducted his campaign as &ldquo;Young
Hickory,&rdquo; the legitimate political heir of the &ldquo;sage of
the Hermitage,&rdquo; was inaugurated.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson and his family, after Van Buren&rsquo;s
inauguration, made a triumphant progress southward
and, on March 25, 1837, reached the Hermitage. To
Martin Van Buren he wrote on March 30: &ldquo;I reached
home ... with a very bad cough, increased by a cold
taken on board the Steam Boat.... I hope rest in
due time may restore my health so as be enabled to
amuse myself in riding over my farm and visiting my
neighbors....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But however interested he was in his farm and his
neighbors he took time to write his successor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;
several pages of very sound advice on state affairs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fearlessly pursue your principles avowed, and the
people will sustain you against all apostates, ambitious,
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
and designing men ...&rdquo; and take care of &ldquo;the safety
of the deposit Banks of the West, and south....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that time onward the Hermitage was prominent
in the eyes of the nation. The younger statesmen
paid visits to &ldquo;the sage of the Hermitage&rdquo; as the ancients
consulted oracles&mdash;and the masses continued to
worship the &ldquo;Hero of New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His domestic life flowed easily and pleasantly under
the skilled and tactful direction of his daughter, Sarah.
The adored little Rachel dogged his footsteps, rode
with him, and, with her bright prattle, enlivened his
days. Mrs. Marion Adams, Sarah&rsquo;s older sister, now
widowed, made her home at the Hermitage, and Rachel&rsquo;s
relatives came from their neighboring estates to pay
respects to their beloved kinsman. Never was a lonely
old man surrounded with greater affection or more
kindly care.</p>
<p>But what of the outward appearance of the Hermitage
of this period? There is every indication that the
cedars along the driveway were set out at this time.
A drawing of the Hermitage dated 1856 indicates that
the cedars were still quite young at that time, and a
statement of Parton, based on his visit to Nashville
prior to the publication of his <i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i>
in 1859, further corroborates it and gives, as well, an
interesting picture of the appearance which the Hermitage
finally assumed after its series of changes. He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we leave the turnpike and turn into a private
road, straight, narrow, a quarter of a mile long, the
land on both sides dead level. We come to a low iron
gate in a white wooden frame, which admits us to an
avenue of young cedars, ending in a grove, through
which a guitar-shaped lawn is visible.... We alight,
at length, on the stone steps of the piazza, and the
Hermitage is before us.... A two-story brick house,
with a double piazza both in front and in the rear; the
piazza wooden and painted white supported by thick
grooved pillars of the same material and color. The
floors of the lower piazza are of stone, and each terminates
in a wing of the house....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A familiar and cherished picture to Tennesseans, and
to many thousands of Americans who have journeyed
the same road to pay tribute to the memory of Andrew
Jackson. Parton, like the Frenchmen with Lafayette,
was struck by the simplicity of the Hermitage, but he
was much impressed with the fertility of the land and
the natural beauty of the estate. Like the Frenchmen,
he, too, was much concerned with the &ldquo;sad spectacle&rdquo;
of slavery, but he was convinced that the Jackson slaves
had an unusually happy lot.</p>
<p>The best-known authority on the laying out of the
cedar drive is the narrative of Mrs. Rachel Jackson
Lawrence (&ldquo;little Rachel&rdquo;) which appears in the second
volume of the late S. G. Heiskell&rsquo;s <i>Andrew Jackson and
Early Tennessee History</i>. Mr. Heiskell was not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
an eminent lawyer, but he was a careful and painstaking
historian. He quotes Mrs. Lawrence as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Earle assisted in laying off the grounds, the
front yard, at the Hermitage. My mother drew the
plan, and Colonel Earle superintended the laying off,
and the planting of all those cedars you can see there.
He also laid off the center of the Hermitage garden.
I think it was exposure to the sun, after being so closely
confined in his studio, that resulted in his death. He
came in, I remember, and sat down at the dinner table,
and said he did not feel very well, thought he had something
like a chill.... When supper time came, he
was still feeling very badly.... About daylight he
died with a congestive chill.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earl&rsquo;s death was mentioned in General Jackson&rsquo;s letters
of September, 1838. &ldquo;His death,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is a
great bereavement to me ... he was my friend and
constant companion....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lawrence&rsquo;s statement does not definitely place
the laying out of the flower beds in the center of the
garden. It is possible that, in those lonely days after
his young wife&rsquo;s death in 1819, he worked with Rachel
Jackson in the garden of her new home. Frost, the
English gardener may have worked with them. At
any rate, the garden grew as the estate developed and,
through the twenty years of his residence at the Hermitage,
it must have delighted the beauty-loving soul of
the artist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>But what suggested the guitar as a model for the
drive? There is a tradition that General Jackson selected
it because Rachel played the guitar&mdash;certainly,
even at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill, she played a harpsichord, and
often accompanied the General when he played upon
his flute. There is definite proof that Sarah York had
a guitar, for General Jackson, in a letter written in
Washington, April 12, 1832, said: &ldquo;Your cousin Saml.
J. Hays has agreed to take the Dog&mdash;will rest at Rockville
with you tonight. He takes on Sarah&rsquo;s Gator
(guitar)&mdash;you must direct him where to leave it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere the connection between music and the
cedars was seen by a mind poetic enough to look forward
to a day when they would grow into a massive
instrument upon which the pleasant winds might play.
Perhaps &ldquo;Old Hickory&rdquo; himself conceived the idea&mdash;at
any rate he approved it, or the drive would not have
been planted. It is enough to know that in planting the
trees he connected them with the music of at least one&mdash;perhaps
two&mdash;mistresses of the Hermitage.</p>
<p>General Jackson was interested, too, in the willows
which he had planted by Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s tomb and in
the flowers she had loved. In a letter written to Andrew
Jackson, Jr., on August 20, 1829, he expresses deep
concern for the care of her grave in the garden:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In your letter although you have informed me of
your visit to your dear mother&rsquo;s tomb, still you have not
informed me of its situation, and whether the weeping
that we planted around it are growing, or whether the
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
flowers reared by her industrious and beloved hands,
have been set around the grave as I requested. My D&rsquo;r
son, inform me on this subject, you know it is the one
dearest to my heart, and her memory will remain fresh
there as long as life lasts....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As long as life lasts....&rdquo; Each evening at sunset
a failing old man turned his footsteps toward the
garden. The chattering little girl who held his hand
paused at the gate and watched in silence while he made
his way slowly down the garden paths to the white stone
temple in the lower end of the garden.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever went to the tomb with him,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lawrence told Mr. Heiskell. &ldquo;I always went to the
gate, and saw him in, but I realized he was going to
the tomb. He would stay there a half hour, I suppose,
then return. He did this as long as he was able to
walk.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not long to wait. Louis Philippe sent the
artist Healy to paint his portrait, and Sam Houston
was hastening from Texas that his fast-failing friend
might lay his hands on his young son&rsquo;s head in blessing.
The portrait was finished three days before the
old General&rsquo;s death, but Sam Houston reached the Hermitage
just a few hours too late.</p>
<p>The end came quietly and peacefully on June 8, 1845,
and two days later Andrew Jackson was laid to rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
beside his beloved Rachel. Their mortal remains have
rested peacefully in the earth they loved these many
years, while the changing seasons have brought their
fleeting beauty to the garden&mdash;but who shall say that
their story has not become immortal?</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">ADDITIONAL NOTES</span></h2>
<p>(Plans for this volume were made during Mrs. E. A.
Lindsey&rsquo;s term as regent of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association.
They were brought to completion during the
administration of her successor, Mrs. Reau E. Folk, with
the full co&ouml;peration of Mrs. Lindsey and other members of
the board of directors. Plans for the present edition were
begun under the regency of Mrs. George F. Blackie and
are being completed under the regency of Mrs. Robert F.
Jackson. The purpose of this little book is to provide a
small, easily readable volume on the Hermitage of Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s day and to bring out certain interesting unpublished
material relating to this period. These additional
notes, given in the briefest possible space, represent material
too voluminous to publish at the present time, but too important
to pass without some mention.)</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Preservation and Refurnishing of the Hermitage.</i>&mdash;The
reader is naturally interested in the period which intervened
between the death of Andrew Jackson and the opening
of his home as a patriotic shrine, the authenticity of
the relics, the degree to which the garden and the grounds
are faithful to their past, and other details of the preservation
of the historic Hermitage estate.</p>
<p>The Hermitage and five hundred acres of adjoining
land were purchased by the State of Tennessee from
Andrew Jackson, Jr., in 1856. At this time Andrew
Johnson, another Tennessean who was to ascend to the
Presidency of the United States, was governor. The original
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
purpose was to tender the property to the United
States Government for the establishment of a military
academy similar to West Point, and such an offer was
made to Congress by the State of Tennessee. The plan
was not consummated, however, for clouds which gave
warning of the great storm of internal strife which was
about to break, obscured all other interests. The Civil War
soon followed and five young men from the Hermitage&mdash;sons
of Sarah York and Andrew Jackson, Jr., and of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
widowed sister, Mrs. Adams&mdash;went to join the Confederate
Army. Only one, Colonel Andrew Jackson, III, returned.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, Jr., died in 1865, but his widow continued,
at the invitation of the State of Tennessee, to live
at the Hermitage until her death in 1888. In the following
year, 1889, the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association was
organized, and on April 5, 1889, the mansion, tomb, and
adjoining buildings were conveyed to the trustees of the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. After this first step the
Association busied itself with the raising of funds for
the purchase of furniture, relics, and valuable papers which
belonged in the mansion and which Col. Andrew Jackson,
III, had inherited from his mother. The major portion of
the present collection was completed by 1900, and in that
year Col. Jackson and his sister, Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence,
signed a statement which forever establishes the
authenticity of the relics. Col. Jackson died in 1906, but
Mrs. Lawrence lived until 1923 and under her guidance,
as well as that of &ldquo;Uncle Alfred,&rdquo; the slave who was General
Jackson&rsquo;s body servant, the furniture was rearranged
as it was when the old warrior lived in the Hermitage.</p>
<p>This work was not done without continuous, untiring,
and devoted effort on the part of the leading spirits of the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. Their work received national
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
recognition in 1907, when President Theodore Roosevelt,
impressed by his visit to the Hermitage, sponsored an
act of Congress which provided $5,000 for additional work
in repairing and preserving the Hermitage as a national
shrine.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Library, or Office.</i>&mdash;Among the most interesting of the
unpublished collections of Jackson material is that owned
by The Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. It has been the
privilege of the writer to make a detailed study of this
material. The library, or office, as it was generally called,
contains over four hundred volumes. One of the most
striking features of this collection is that such a large portion
of it is the work of Jackson&rsquo;s contemporaries&mdash;not only
in military and political subjects, but in biography, fiction,
and poetry.</p>
<p>There are a number of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s works, including
his <i>Life of Napoleon</i>, <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>, and
others. There is Henry Fielding&rsquo;s <i>History of Tom Jones</i>,
some volumes of Addison&rsquo;s <i>Spectator</i>, Dickens&rsquo; <i>Oliver
Twist</i>, Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, Jane Porter&rsquo;s <i>Scottish
Chiefs</i> and <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i>, Milton, Shakespeare, and
a score of others reflecting lively and varied taste.</p>
<p>The collection shows that it was acquired naturally and
gradually, for the purpose of meeting the needs and the
interests of the household. There are law books, religious
writings, biography, technical books on military subjects,
numbers of bound political pamphlets, current magazines,
and a few newspapers, as well as the previously mentioned
fiction and poetry. There are also various publications on
agriculture, cook books, music books, hymnals, and, most
delightful of all for the human touch it gives, a baby book
published in 1805!</p>
<p>This book, <i>A Treatise on the Diseases of Children, with
Directions for the Management of Children from Birth</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
was published in 1805 in London. It was written by
Michael Underwood, M.D., of the Royal College of Physicians,
Physician to Her Royal Highness the Princess of
Wales.</p>
<p>It was, most likely, the most important book at the
Hermitage in 1809, when Rachel and Andrew took into
their hearts the infant nephew who became their adopted
son and heir.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Slaves.</i>&mdash;No history of the Hermitage is complete without
at least a reference to the slaves who toiled in its
fields, attended the thoroughbreds in its stables, or performed
duties at &ldquo;the big house&rdquo; with well-bred courtesy
and ease. Some few live by name, but most of them, like
shadows in a brilliantly colored picture, have passed into
a hazy, undefined background. Alfred sleeps in a marked
grave in the garden, only a few feet from his beloved
master. Across the fence, a few feet from the family burying
ground, are other unidentified graves&mdash;among them,
it is said, is that of Gracie, Alfred&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, during the bitter campaign of 1828,
was accused of being a negro trader. Nothing could be
more absurd to people who understand the conditions under
which he lived. He bought slaves and, occasionally, sold
them&mdash;but slave dealing implies constant trade in negroes
for profit and the records do not indicate, at any period of
his life, that he deserves the opprobrious term of negro
trader.</p>
<p>Among the slaves of the early period of the Jackson
household were more than likely George and Moll, who
were given to Rachel in 1791, as a part of the property
which she inherited in the settlement of her father&rsquo;s estate.
Davidson County court records show that in the same year
Andrew Jackson bought a man named Peter and a six-year-old
boy, named Aron. In 1793 he bought a negro girl
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
named Peg, about twenty-six years old; a little later a
negro girl named Rock, aged about twelve years; and
on July 8, 1794, &ldquo;A negro wench by the name of Hannah
and her child called Bett,&rdquo; for 80 pounds Virginia currency.
Hannah rose to an important position in the household.
She was, in more ways than one, to be Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s right
hand&mdash;she supervised the poultry, the household, and
seemed to be, in addition to these duties, personal maid
to her mistress. It was she who nursed Rachel in her last
illness.</p>
<p>Hannah passed to Sarah York Jackson, by gift of General
Jackson, along with Alfred, Gracie, George Washington,
Mary, Augustus, Sarah, and others. (Slave deed&mdash;original
at Tennessee State Library&mdash;dated August 16, 1854&mdash;A.
Jackson, Jr.)</p>
<p>When the Hermitage was transferred to the custody of
the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association &ldquo;Uncle Alfred,&rdquo; by legislative
request, went with it.</p>
<p>Senate Joint Resolution, No. 14, adopted April 3, 1889,
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State
of Tennessee, That &mdash;&mdash; Jackson, colored, an old manservant
of General Andrew Jackson, who now lives in a
small cabin within one hundred yards of the tomb of General
Jackson, that in transferring the Hermitage to the
Confederate Home Association and the Ladies&rsquo; Association,
by recent legislation, that we request the Trustees of the
Confederate Home Association and the Ladies&rsquo; Association,
not to disturb this old and good negro, but allow him to
live in his cabin until he is called to meet his master on the
other side of the river, and rest with him under the shade
of the trees.</p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;Benj. J. Lea, Speaker of the Senate; W. L. Clapp, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Approved April 6, 1889. Robert L. Taylor, Governor.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; Alfred, who was born in 1803, died September 4,
1901. In fulfilment of his dearest wish he was buried near
the tomb of his master, where he does, indeed, in the words
of the dying Confederate general, Stonewall Jackson, &ldquo;rest
under the shade of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Sword Presented to Andrew Jackson by Citizens of Philadelphia.</i>&mdash;(Niles
Register&mdash;Vol. 47&mdash;p. 402. Issue of February
7, 1835.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Philadelphia, January 1st, 1835.</span></p>
<p>To gen. Andrew Jackson, president of the United States.</p>
<p>Sir: The undersigned citizens of Philadelphia, beg leave, on the
anniversary of the glorious battle of New Orleans, to offer, by the attention
of their friend, Col. A. L. Rumfort, the accompanying sword,
from the manufacture of their fellow citizen, Mr. F. W. Widmann,
as a testimonial of their love and gratitude towards the benefactor of
their country.</p>
<p>The artist has endeavored, in the ornamental work, to depict that
conflict, which resulted in the most decisive and glorious victory
known to our American annals. Art may indeed be inadequate to do
justice to such a subject, but its details will be indelibly engraved on
the minds and memories of the present and of each succeeding generation
of Americans, worthy of the name. In an equal degree must
their grateful hearts be impressed with the image of the devoted patriot
chief, who, battling for THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE&rsquo;S
RIGHTS, is ever invincible, by foreign or domestic foes, by force or
fraud, unconquered and unconquerable.</p>
<p>With sentiments of the highest esteem, we remain your friends and
fellow citizens.</p>
<p>(Here follow the names of between 60 and 70 gentlemen.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Washington, January 8, 1835.</span></p>
<p>Sir: I receive, with emotions of the deepest gratitude, the sword you
are pleased to present me as a testimonial of the regard which a portion
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
of my friends, in Philadelphia, entertain of my services at New
Orleans, this day twenty years ago. In memory of the troops that co&ouml;perated
with me on that occasion, and to whose patriotism and courage
more than to the skill of their commanding general, the country
is indebted for the signal repulse of the enemy on the 8th of January,
I accept it with a pleasure which I cannot express.</p>
<p>I pray to you, sir, to convey to the gentlemen who have united with
you in the presentation of this sword, my sincere thanks for the honor
due me personally, and the assurances that it shall be preserved as a
memento, valuable as a specimen of manufacture, and useful to those
who will come after us, as a proof that the public service of the soldier
will always find in the approbation of a free people the fullest
reward.</p>
<p>Allow me, sir, to tender to you personally my acknowledgments for
the eloquent and complimentary terms you have employed in the execution
of the trust assigned to you on this occasion. I am, very respectfully,
your obedient servant,</p>
<p><span class="lr">ANDREW JACKSON.</span></p>
<p>Col. A. L. Rumfort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb"><i>The Artist, Ralph E. W. Earl, &ldquo;Court Painter.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Most
of the portraits in the Hermitage collection are the work of
Ralph Eleazar Whitesides Earl, who was born in New York
City about 1788. He was a son of the eminent American
artist, Ralph Earl, and his second wife, Anne Whitesides.
Little is known of his early life, but information supplied the
author in 1936 by Ralph E. W. Prime, Jr., of Yonkers and
New York City, New York, indicates that he went abroad
prior to the War of 1812, painted numerous portraits in
England and France, and returned to the United States
some time between the summer of 1815 and the early part of
1817. His long residence in the Hermitage household and
his numerous portraits of General Jackson&rsquo;s kinsmen and
friends caused him to be dubbed &ldquo;The Court Painter.&rdquo; The
correct spelling of the branch of the family to which he belongs
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
is &ldquo;Earl,&rdquo; although historians frequently add a final
&ldquo;e&rdquo; to his name.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>The Garden.</i>&mdash;It seems appropriate to add to that which
has already been written about the garden an important
letter written to the late Miss Louise Grundy Lindsley,
charter member, former regent, and member of the board of
directors, of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association, by Mrs.
Rachel Jackson Lawrence, about a year before the latter&rsquo;s
death. The letter states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As you enter the garden gate, you find the fringe tree
planted by Grand-pa. Passing down the walk, you find
the crepe myrtle on either side. Along the border farther
down, are lilac and syringa. At the far side of the middle
plot, there is a smoke tree, and following the path down,
you find lilac, crepe myrtle, mock orange, and along the
back fence of the garden these same shrubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you enter the gate on the left-hand side, is the calicanthus
or Sweet Betsy. There are the fig bushes, the flowering
almond, and many other shrubs. Around the tomb
are the magnolias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the garden, the flowers were the June lily, lily-of-the-valley,
single white and blue hyacinth, the red, the white
and the pink peonies, blooming in succession as named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The center beds were filled with the old fashioned sweet-williams,
petunias, periwinkles, blue-bells, pinks, and other
garden flowers. There were iris and jonquils, and, as we
called them, golden candle-sticks. There was the coral
honeysuckle, which hung in great clusters, on the right
side of the formal plot. Among the roses, there was the
old-fashioned little yellow rose, the hundred leaf pink rose,
the moss rose, and the large white cabbage rose. There
was the Japanese magnolia planted near the center, the rare
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
cucumber magnolia, the very rare tree peony. Like all old
gardens, in the corners were violets and blue bottles. Box
trees marked the corners of the walks. There were several
evergreens around the tomb and a bunch of hickory trees
planted by Grand-pa. Now this is all that I can remember.
Signed&mdash;Rachel Jackson Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sarah York Jackson, who spoke often of the Hermitage
garden in letters to her sons, wrote Andrew Jackson, III, in
the spring of 1852:</p>
<p>&ldquo;... all our early flowers are destroyed, also all the
first plants of vegetables. You would be grieved to see our
garden. We are making some few improvements in it this
season, bricking around the beds, and have had a supply
of fine roses. We have now about fifty varieties of roses,
some very fine....&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this gracious, devoted woman was given the privilege
of guarding Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage and its cherished
garden through long, weary years of war, sorrow, poverty
and neglect, until the hands of other women reached out
to carry the responsibilities which Death alone caused her
to relinquish.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">FOOTNOTES</span></h2>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The origin of the name of Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage estate is obscure.
Thomas Hart Benton, in his <i>Thirty Years&rsquo; View</i>, Vol. I, page 736,
says: &ldquo;He ... lived on a superb estate of some thousand acres,
twelve miles from Nashville, then hardly known by its subsequent
famous name of the Hermitage&mdash;name chosen for its perfect accord
with his feelings; for he had then actually withdrawn from the stage
of public life....&rdquo;</div>
<div class="fncont">Mr. W. E. Beard, of Nashville, a well-known writer and historian,
suggests that Jackson may have been influenced by the name of
Aaron Burr&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;Before Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage there were at
least two other homes, associated with noteworthy figures in American
history, bearing the name. One was the Hermitage of Gen. Arthur
St. Clair ... located near Youngstown, Pa. The other Hermitage
was in New Jersey and has more romantic associations. It was the
home during the Revolution of the beautiful Widow Prevost, the beloved
of Col. Aaron Burr, later his wife and the mother of the
gifted Theodosia.... One of Jackson&rsquo;s earliest visitors of note
at his Hermitage was Col. Burr.... A reasonable supposition
would be that the charming adventurer, remembering the days of his
dashing courtship in Jersey, suggested the name for the new home
of his host.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="fncont">Mr. Beard remarks that Burr visited Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage after
its name was in use. In support of his theory it may be stated,
however, that Jackson had known Burr since 1797. There is, as
far as is known at present, nothing to prove definitely the origin of
the name of Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>An old log building, said to have been Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s
carriage house at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill, has been removed to the Hermitage.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>In 1817 Truxton, then seventeen years old, was presented by
General Jackson to Col. Robert Butler, adjutant-general of the
New Orleans campaign, who resided in the Mississippi Territory.
&ldquo;I drop you a hasty line to inform you of the safe arrival of
Truxton,&rdquo; wrote Col. Butler to General Jackson, on April 20, 1817.
&ldquo;I met him at Ft. Adams landing yesterday.... My dear Genl
I feel under great obligations to you for this Horse of Horses. I
certainly never beheld a more noble animal.... I shall cherish
and pet him as a great favorite as long as he lives.&rdquo;

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
